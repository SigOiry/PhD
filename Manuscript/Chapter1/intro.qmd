## Coastal Environment

Marine coastal zones are among the most densely populated regions globally, serving as critical hubs for economic activity, transportation, and tourism. These areas support diverse ecosystems and provide essential resources. Additionally, they play a pivotal role in global trade and commerce while also offering cultural and recreational value. However, their popularity and utility make them highly vulnerable to environmental pressures such as pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change impacts like sea-level rise and coastal erosion. Effective management and sustainable practices are crucial to preserving their ecological integrity and ensuring long-term viability.

Marine vegetative habitats in intertidal zones that are exposed at low tide (such as seagrass meadows, microphytobenthos, and macroalgae) are significantly impacted by human activities. Seagrass meadows are under threat due to various anthropogenic activities [@mckenzie2020global], microphytobenthos are affected by the global decline of intertidal mudflats [@murray2019global], and areas colonized by macroalgae may be reduced due to the expansion of wild oysters [@le2016hyperspectral].

These habitats provide vital ecological functions, including coastal erosion protection through root stabilization and sediment trapping (**refs**), mitigation of eutrophication effects by absorbing excess nutrients and improving water quality (**refs**), atmospheric CO2 fixation, contributing to carbon sequestration and combating climate change (**refs**), serving as biodiversity hotspots that support unique flora and fauna, providing feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for various species. Despite their ecological significance, intertidal zones, particularly mudflats, are challenging to access, and traditional field sampling methods are too time- and labor-intensive to allow repeated observations over large areas. This limitation underscores the need for advanced monitoring technologies to better assess and protect these habitats.

Intertidal habitats, at the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, face significant pressures from both anthropogenic activities and natural forces affecting both realms. Human-induced threats include coastal development, pollution, overfishing, and habitat modification, which degrade these ecosystems and diminish the valuable ecosystem services they provide. Meanwhile, natural factors such as storms, sea-level rise, climatic extreme events and climate change exacerbate these pressures, altering the structure function, and resilience of intertidal habitats. Despite their ecological importance in supporting biodiversity, providing coastal protection, and contributing to nutrient cycling, intertidal habitats remain highly vulnerable. Addressing these challenges requires robust management practices, targeted conservation strategies, and ongoing monitoring to ensure their sustainability and resilience against future pressures.

### Ecological and Socio-Economic importance of Coastal Environments

Coastal environments represent a complex and dynamic interface between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, characterized by exceptional biodiversity, diverse geomorphological structures, and significant socio-economic relevance. These regions span a continuum that includes saltmarshes, beaches, dunes, estuaries, deltas, tidal flats, wetlands, rocky shores, biogenic reefs and lagoons, each shaped by a combination of natural processes and anthropogenic influences [@laignel2023observation].

The coastal zone encompasses areas where terrestrial and marine domains intersect, including environments influenced by tidal flows, wave dynamics, and riverine inputs. This transition zone can extend from a few hundred meters inland to several kilometers offshore, depending on local topography and ecological gradients. It incorporates upper shores and dunes, intertidal zones, periodically submerged and exposed by tidal activity, as well as subtidal zones that remain submerged permanently (@fig-CoastalHabitat ; @laignel2023observation).

As one of the most dynamic and multifaceted regions on Earth, coastal environments host highly diverse and productive habitats. These include both natural ecosystems and managed systems that underpin key economic sectors and urban centers. The functionality of many coastal ecosystems is intrinsically linked to land-sea interactions, as observed in deltas and estuaries. These environments exhibit steep gradients in salinity---from freshwater to hypersaline---and energy levels, ranging from low-energy wetlands to high-energy, wave-dominated shorelines. On a broader scale, coastal regions encompass a spectrum of climatic zones, from tropical to polar, each characterized by unique biogeophysical processes and features. However, these areas are also exposed to a variety of land-based and marine hazards, including storms, tropical cyclones, storm surges, tsunamis, riverine flooding, shoreline erosion, sea-level rise and biohazards such as algal blooms and pollutants.

Coastal ecosystems provide a range of ecosystem services that are fundamental to environmental sustainability and human well-being. These ecosystems function as natural barriers against storm surges and coastal flooding, thereby mitigating the impacts of such hazards on inland regions and safeguarding human lives and infrastructure. They support significant biodiversity, serving as critical habitats and breeding grounds for numerous species, including commercially valuable fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms that sustain global fisheries. Coastal vegetation, including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration by capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus contributing to climate change mitigation.

Beyond their role in climate regulation, coastal ecosystems enhance water quality by filtering pollutants, sediments, and excess nutrients, thereby maintaining healthier marine and estuarine systems. These ecosystems are integral to nutrient cycling, ensuring the continued productivity of adjacent marine environments. Additionally, they provide substantial cultural, educational, and recreational opportunities, drawing global attention and fostering an intrinsic human connection to nature. This societal value contributes directly to local and regional economies through industries such as tourism, artisanal fishing, and related enterprises. Furthermore, coastal ecosystems supply essential natural resources, including seafood and plant-based materials, while supporting sustainable aquaculture practices that promote global food security and bolster local livelihoods. Collectively, these functions highlight the indispensable ecological and economic importance of coastal ecosystems.

### Human Activities in Coastal Areas and their Environmental Impacts 

Coastal areas are among the most significant regions for human habitation due to their strategic geographic position, resource availability, and economic opportunities. Currently, approximately 2 billion people reside within 50 kilometers of coastlines, with nearly 1 billion living within 10 kilometers. This represents nearly 15% of the global population occupying only 4% of the Earth's inhabitable landmass. Projections indicate that coastal populations will continue to rise, potentially reaching 2.9 billion by 2100 under various socioeconomic scenarios. These areas offer critical resources such as seafood and freshwater, while their moderate climates often support agricultural activities and other forms of sustainable land use. Proximity to oceans and rivers enables robust trade, transportation, and industrial growth, positioning many coastal cities as pivotal economic hubs on a global scale. The ecological and cultural roles of coastal landscapes further contribute to their appeal, attracting populations for both settlement and economic activities.

Human utilization of coastal areas spans a range of economic and social activities that highlight both the benefits and challenges of these environments. [Coastal tourism](https://blue-economy-observatory.ec.europa.eu/eu-blue-economy-sectors/coastal-tourism_en) is a significant driver of economic growth, particularly in regions like the European Union (EU). In 2021, the EU's coastal tourism sector generated approximately €49.9 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) and employed around 1.9 million people. [Coastal fishing](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/aquafarming-becomes-main-global-source-fish-un-food-agency-says-2024-06-07) and aquaculture are vital components of the global economy, providing employment to millions and contributing significantly to food security. In 2022, the combined global production of fisheries and aquaculture reached a record 223.2 million tonnes, with aquaculture alone producing an unprecedented 130.9 million tonnes. Notably, for the first time, aquaculture surpassed wild capture in aquatic animal production, accounting for 51% of the total. Additionally, [maritime shipping](https://maritime-union.org/how-much-trade-is-maritime/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is the backbone of international trade, with approximately 80% of global trade by volume and over 70% by value transported via sea routes. This extensive reliance on maritime transport underscores the critical importance of coastal infrastructure, including ports and harbors, in facilitating the movement of goods worldwide.
However, the intensive exploitation of coastal environments for human activities has led to significant ecological challenges.

For instance, marine shipping contributes about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure projected to rise by up to 50% by mid-century if stringent measures are not implemented [@IMO2020GHG]. Additionally, shipping activities lead to marine pollution, including oil spills, ballast water discharge and underwater noise and light affecting marine life. Oil spills remain a critical environmental concern due to their devastating and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems. These spills contaminate water, harm marine biodiversity, and disrupt food chains, often leading to severe economic losses in fisheries and tourism. In 2023, ten oil spills were recorded globally, releasing over 2,000 tons of oil into the environment, including one major spill exceeding 700 tons in Asia [@itopf_statistics]. While historical trends show a reduction in large spills, from over 20 per year in the 1970s to about 1.3 per year in recent decades, incidents such as the spill occured in December 2024 in the Kerch Strait, where 3,700 tons of oil were released, underscore the persistent and significant risks. Such events highlight the necessity for stringent preventive measures and rapid response mechanisms to mitigate the ongoing threat posed by oil spills to marine environments. 
Ballast water discharge represents a significant vector for the introduction of invasive aquatic species into new environments. Approximately 40% of introductions of non-indigenous aquatic species have been linked to ballast water release. Underwater noise pollution from shipping activities poses a growing threat to marine life, particularly cetaceans such as whales and dolphins. Elevated noise levels can disrupt communication, navigation, and feeding behaviors, leading to increased stress and altered migration patterns. Chronic exposure to underwater noise can also result in physical harm and population-level impacts. One significant impact of fishing and aquaculture on coastal habitats is the degradation of critical ecosystems such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves. Destructive fishing practices, including bottom trawling and the use of dynamite or cyanide, physically damage the seafloor and associated habitats, resulting in biodiversity loss and the disruption of ecological functions. The expansion of aquaculture operations often necessitates the conversion of coastal wetlands, particularly mangroves, into fish or shrimp ponds. This land-use change reduces the availability of essential nursery habitats for marine species and diminishes the ecosystem services provided by mangroves, such as carbon sequestration, shoreline stabilization, and water filtration. Additionally, aquaculture activities contribute to nutrient enrichment and pollution in adjacent waters through the release of uneaten feed, feces, and chemical additives, exacerbating eutrophication and altering benthic community structures. Another significant concern is the introduction of alien invasive species into the environment through aquaculture, which can disrupt local ecosystems and biodiversity. This issue was explored in Chapter 4. Coastal tourism exerts a profound influence on ecosystem integrity, often driving substantial environmental degradation through mechanisms such as habitat destruction, pollution, and resource overexploitation. The construction and expansion of tourist infrastructure frequently lead to the removal or fragmentation of critical habitats, including mangroves, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs, all of which play pivotal roles in maintaining biodiversity and safeguarding coastal resilience. Furthermore, the rapid influx of visitors generates significant volumes of waste and untreated sewage, contributing to water quality deterioration and eutrophication, which disrupt aquatic ecosystems and alter trophic dynamics. The elevated demand for limited resources, notably freshwater and seafood, exacerbates ecological stress, leading to overharvesting and resource depletion.

\begin{tcolorbox}
The dynamic interactions between terrestrial and marine systems are particularly evident in intertidal habitats, which exemplify the transitional nature of coastal zones. The next section will focus on these habitats, exploring their ecological significance, the processes shaping them, and the challenges they face under increasing environmental and anthropogenic pressures.
\end{tcolorbox}
```

### Tidal flats

The intertidal zone refers to the coastal area between the high and low tide marks, characterized by periodic exposure and submersion due to tidal cycles. This dynamic zone forms the interface between terrestrial and marine ecosystems and is influenced by complex physical, chemical, and biological processes.

Tidal flats, a specific type of intertidal habitat, are defined as expanses of sand, rock, or mud that experience regular tidal inundation. These ecosystems are shaped by sediment deposition driven by tidal currents, wave action, and terrestrial runoff. As transitional ecosystems between terrestrial and marine environments, tidal flats face pressures from both domains. Additionally, they encounter unique threats, including coastal development [@hassan2005ecosystems ; @arkema2013coastal], rising sea levels [@passeri2015dynamic ; @lovelock2017mangrove], coastal erosion [@Nicholls2007], decreased sediment input from rivers [@blum2009drowning], and the subsidence and compaction of coastal sediments [@minderhoud2020groundwater].

Globally, tidal flats are experiencing significant declines in extent due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. @murray2019global using a satellite timeserie from 1984 to 2016 have shown that tidal flats have declined by approximately 16% over this period, representing a net loss of over 20,000 km² (@fig-TidalFlats).

```

Regions such as East Asia, the Middle East, and North America have shown the greatest losses. These declines mirror trends observed in other coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses. Despite these losses, some areas have exhibited resilience or even expansion, highlighting the dynamic interplay between sedimentary processes, sea-level rise, and human interventions [@murray2019global].

A potential solution to limit the disappearance of tidal flats is to protect the ecosystems they host. These ecosystems contribute significantly to nutrient cycling and sediment stabilization, enhancing the overall resilience of tidal flats. By maintaining these biotic communities, the ecological functions of tidal flats can be preserved, buffering them against threats such as erosion and rising sea levels.

```{=latex}
\begin{tcolorbox}
The main vegetation classes found on tidal flats will be introduced in the following sections, as Chapters 2 and 3 rely specifically on distinguishing between these classes. Here, "classes" is considered in its taxonomic sense, referring to a toaxonomic rank that groups related orders of organisms sharing a common ancestor.
\end{tcolorbox}
```

#### Bacillariophyceae, Euglenida and Cyanophyceae 

Within estuarine biological communities, the microphytobenthos (MPB) can contribute up to 50% of total primary production [@n1999primary]. This assemblage comprises unicellular algae—particularly epipsammic diatoms (associated with sand grains) and epipelic diatoms (free and motile within muddy sediments, @fig-MPBpictures B)—as well as cyanobacteria and euglenids [@macintyre1996microphytobenthos]. These organisms proliferate on sediment surfaces during low tide [@kelly2001attenuation], colonizing intertidal superficial sediments and forming biofilms (@fig-MPBpictures A) that can extend over several square kilometers [@benyoucef2014microphytobenthos].

```{r Figs MPBpictures}

#| fig-cap: "Picture of the sampling of microphytobenthos biofilm in the Guadalquivir river, on the 22nd of March 2023 (A) and a single diatoms cell (B), likely *Navicula spp.* took using a scanning transmission electron microscope by Alexandre Barnett."
#| label: fig-MPBpictures
#| out-width: "100%"

knitr::include_graphics("Figs/MPB/MPB_pictures.png")
```

The MPB fulfills both structural and trophic functions within intertidal mudflats. Structurally, microphytobenthic biofilms decelerate sediment resuspension and enhance mudflat stability by mitigating erosive processes [@decho2000microbial]. Trophically, they serve as a food resource for deposit-feeding and suspension-feeding invertebrates [@miller1996microphytobenthos]. The MPB forms the foundation of various food chains, being consumed at low tide by organisms ranging from gastropods [@savelli2018biotic] to shorebirds [@drouet2015utilisation]. Additionally, at high tide, tidal currents and waves can resuspend the MPB, making it available in the water column for suspension feeders and facilitating the export of a portion of its biomass to adjacent ecosystems [@de1995wind ; @decottignies2007exploitation].

The MPB's role in sediment stabilization is further supported by its production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which enhance sediment cohesion and reduce erosion. Moreover, the MPB contributes to nutrient cycling within coastal ecosystems, influencing the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential for primary production. The dynamic nature of MPB communities allows them to adapt to varying environmental conditions, making them integral to the resilience and functioning of coastal habitats.

#### Chlorophyceae 

Green macroalgae, belonging to the Class of Chlorophyceae, are a diverse group of multicellular photosynthetic organisms predominantly inhabiting marine environments, though some species are found in freshwater and terrestrial habitats (@fig-vegetation D). They are characterized by their green pigmentation, resulting from the dominance of chlorophylls a and b, which play a crucial role in their photosynthetic processes [@cikovs2022recent]. 

Ecologically, green macroalgae are significant primary producers, contributing substantially to the productivity of coastal ecosystems. Species such as those in the genus *Ulva* are known for their rapid growth rates and are often indicators of nutrient-rich conditions [@liu2020role]. 

In addition to their ecological roles, green macroalgae have been utilized in various human applications. They are cultivated for food used in aquaculture and their potential in biofuel production and as bioindicators for monitoring environmental health is being actively researched [@moreira2022underexplored]. 

However, under conditions of eutrophication—excessive nutrient enrichment—green macroalgae can proliferate excessively, leading to algal blooms. These blooms can have detrimental effects on marine ecosystems, including hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and the displacement of other important species [@schreyers2021spotting ; @sun2022prevention].

#### Phaeophyceae

Brown macroalgae, classified under the class Phaeophyceae, are a diverse group of multicellular marine algae predominantly found in temperate and polar coastal regions (@fig-vegetation B). Their characteristic brown coloration arises from the presence of the pigment fucoxanthin, which masks the green of chlorophylls a and c. This pigmentation is integral to their photosynthetic efficiency, particularly in low-light underwater environments [@cikovs2022recent]. 

Ecologically, brown macroalgae play a pivotal role in marine ecosystems. They form extensive underwater forests, commonly known as kelp forests, which provide habitat, food, and shelter for a multitude of marine organisms, thereby enhancing local biodiversity. These structures influence coastal oceanography by affecting water flow and light penetration. In intertidal areas, they often colonize rocky substrat, creating suitable habitat for various species like sea anemone, limpet and fishes [@eger2023value]. 

In terms of human utilization, brown macroalgae have been harvested for centuries for various purposes. They are a source of alginates—polysaccharides extracted from their cell walls—widely used as gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agents in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries, but as also the potential to be uses in Lithium-ion batteries production [@kovalenko2011major]. Additionally, certain species are consumed directly as food, particularly in East Asian cuisines, and are recognized for their nutritional value and health benefits. 

Brown macroalgae also contribute to environmental management practices. Their ability to absorb and accumulate heavy metals makes them effective in bioremediation efforts to remove pollutants from marine environments [@davis2003review]. Furthermore, their potential in carbon sequestration positions them as valuable components in strategies aimed at mitigating climate change impacts. 

However, brown macroalgae are susceptible to environmental changes. Factors such as ocean warming, pollution, and overfishing can lead to declines in their populations, which in turn affects the broader marine ecosystems they support [@manca2024projected]. Conservation and sustainable management of these algae are therefore crucial to maintaining the health and productivity of coastal marine environments.

#### Rhodophyceae

Red macroalgae, or Rhodophyta, constitute a diverse group of predominantly marine, multicellular algae characterized by their reddish pigmentation, which results from the presence of phycoerythrin and phycocyanin pigments (@fig-vegetation C). These pigments enable red algae to efficiently absorb blue and green wavelengths of light, facilitating photosynthesis at greater ocean depths compared to other algal groups [@cikovs2022recent]. 

Ecologically, red macroalgae play a vital role in marine environments. They contribute significantly to primary production and serve as foundational species in various marine habitats. Notably, coralline red algae, which secrete calcium carbonate, are instrumental in building and stabilizing coral reef structures, providing habitat complexity that supports diverse marine life [@cornwall2023crustose]. 

In terms of human utilization, red macroalgae have been harvested for centuries for their nutritional and industrial value. Species such as *Porphyra* (known as nori in Japan and gim in Korea) and *Palmaria palmata* (dulse) are consumed as food, valued for their high protein content, essential vitamins, and minerals [@wei2023influence ; @stevant2023concise]. Additionally, red algae are a primary source of phycocolloids like agar and carrageenan, which are extensively used as gelling and stabilizing agents in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries [@nurdin2023precision ; @valderrama2013social]. 

Red macroalgae also possess bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic applications. Research has identified various secondary metabolites in red algae that exhibit antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, highlighting their potential in drug development and functional food ingredients [@ismail2020therapeutic]. 

However, red macroalgae face challenges due to environmental changes. Factors such as climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction can adversely affect their populations and the ecosystems they support. Conservation efforts and sustainable harvesting practices are essential to preserve these ecologically and economically important organisms [@hanley2024victim].

#### Magnoliopsida

Intertidal seagrass meadows, classified under the class Magnoliopsida, consist of flowering plants adapted to the unique challenges of periodic exposure and submersion in the intertidal zone. These meadows stabilize sediments via their root systems, which anchor substrates and mitigate erosion, thereby reducing sediment loss and maintaining substrate integrity [@davies2024intertidal ; @zoffoli2023remote ; @sousa2019blue]. Additionally, seagrass meadows provide essential ecosystem services, including acting as habitat, nurseries or feeding location for numerous species (@fig-SeagrassHabitat), many of which are commercially important [@moussa2020importance]. Their structural complexity offers refuge from predators, supporting juvenile survival and biodiversity. These meadows play a significant role in global carbon sequestration, capturing and storing carbon at rates comparable to, or exceeding, terrestrial forests. 
Furthermore, they regulate nutrient cycles and improve water quality by trapping sediments and filtering pollutants, thus sustaining the health of adjacent marine environments [@de2019recent]. By cycling nutrients and contributing organic matter through detritus production, intertidal seagrass meadows enhance the ecological productivity and resilience of tidal flats, underscoring their critical role in supporting both ecological functions and socio-economic benefits. 

Seagrass meadows, much like tidal flats, are undergoing significant declines on a global scale due to a variety of anthropogenic and natural stressors. Despite their critical ecological roles, seagrass ecosystems remain comparatively underrepresented in scientific research within the broader scope of coastal ecosystems. As illustrated in @fig-SeagrassHabitat (e), the proportion of publications focusing on seagrasses in the context of coastal ecosystem studies is considerably lower than those dedicated to other key habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves, and salt marshes. This disparity highlights a critical research gap, underscoring the need for increased scientific attention to better understand and mitigate the factors contributing to the degradation of these vital ecosystems.

\begin{tcolorbox}
Traditional field-based sampling methods have proven to be highly effective for studying coastal environments at localized or small spatial scales, providing detailed insights into species composition, habitat structure, and ecological interactions. However, these approaches face significant limitations when applied to broader spatial extents or temporal scales due to their labor-intensive nature and logistical constraints. This methodological gap poses challenges for evaluating large-scale patterns and long-term changes in coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows, mangroves, and tidal flats. Remote sensing technologies, with their ability to capture high-resolution data across extensive geographic areas and over multiple time periods, offer a powerful complementary tool to address these limitations. By integrating traditional methods with remote sensing approaches, it allows a more comprehensive understanding of coastal ecosystem dynamics, facilitating the assessment of both localized impacts and global trends. The following section explores how advancements in remote sensing technologies are transforming the study of coastal environments, enabling more efficient and scalable assessments.
\end{tcolorbox}

## Concepts of Remote sensing

Remote sensing (RS) defines the ability to retrieve information in a non-invasive way, without direct contact with the target. It relies on the propagation of signals, typically optical, acoustic, or microwave, between the target and the sensor. This technology has been applied in a wide variety of fields, ranging from medical imaging to detect stem cells, to the analysis of the structure of the primordial universe [@zhu2021deep ; @aghanim2020resultats]. Remote sensing provides the basis to Earth observation (EO), where its methodologies facilitate large-scale and long-term data collection. Instruments on satellites, aircraft, and drones provide high-resolution imagery and measurements critical for monitoring environmental changes, mapping natural resources, and assessing land use patterns. These technologies enable systematic data collection over large areas and extended periods, supporting analyses such as deforestation, glacial melting, variations in ocean temperature, and changes in land use.

### Active Remote Sensing, Exemple of the LiDAR

Active remote sensing is a technique in which a sensor emits its own energy---typically in the form of electromagnetic radiation---toward a target and measures the energy reflected or backscattered from it. This method allows for the collection of data regardless of natural light conditions, enabling observations during both day and night and through various weather conditions.

The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor emit laser beams in the ultraviolet (UV), visible or infrared (IR) regions of the eletromagnetic spectrum. By analyzing the return signal, they can estimate distances to objects or surfaces, detect optically active constituents in water bodies, and assess aerosols in the atmosphere [@jamet2019going ; @dionisi2024exploring]

LiDAR works by emitting a beam of light and measuring the time it takes for the beam to return to the sensor. This process not only calculates distances but also captures the intensity of the returned signal. In many instances, multiple returns from a single pulse are measured, enabling the mapping of varying objects height within the same x and y coordinates. This capability allows the creation of precise, three-dimensional representations of the environment such as mapping the heights of trees in forests or measuring crop heights in agricultural fields [@fig-LIDAR]. When ground height cannot be direclty measured, LiDAR data can generate a digital surface model (DSM), which represents the uppermost layer of the environment. However, if multiple returns are recorded, it becomes possible to create both a DSM and a digital terrain model (DTM), which represents the ground surface, by differentiating between the surface and underlying layers. The difference between DSM and DTM can be used to assess living stock or biomass.

Achieving accurate 3D measurements of a target using LiDAR technology requires a high level of precision in assessing each parameter of the system. The quality of the final output depends on careful calibration and execution at every stage of the process. One of the critical steps is ensuring the precise timing of the laser beam's return after it reflects off the target. This timing directly determines the distance calculations that form the basis of the 3D structure. Equally important is the accurate positioning of the LiDAR sensor, which is often mounted on a drone, aircraft, or satellite. The sensor's x, y, and z coordinates must be continuously tracked with a high degree of precision. To achieve this, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning systems are commonly employed. These systems enhance the accuracy of the positioning data by providing real-time corrections to the sensor's GPS coordinates, ensuring minimal error and maintaining the integrity of the spatial measurements. Without such stringent measures, the resulting LiDAR data is prone to errors that can lead to distorted and noisy representations of the mapped surface. These inaccuracies not only diminish the reliability of the data but also compromise its utility for detailed analysis and decision-making processes.

In coastal environment monitoring, LiDAR systems are classified based on their emitted wavelengths, which determine their performance and application. These systems are categorized into "topographic LiDAR" and "bathymetric LiDAR," each suited to specific tasks in coastal studies. Topographic LiDAR operates in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum (approximately 1000 nm) and is used to map terrestrial features, such as beach contours, vegetation density, rocky shore structures and man-made installations. Its ability to generate high-density point clouds stems from efficient operation at lower power. Unlike other types of LiDAR, NIR LiDAR require less power, making it generally more affordable and compact. These attributes allow topographic LiDAR systems to be easily mounted on drone platforms, offering greater flexibility and accessibility for coastal monitoring. In contrast, bathymetric LiDAR, utilizing green wavelengths (\~532 nm), penetrates the water column to reveal submerged landscapes, including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and shallow seabeds. Operating within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is more susceptible to atmospheric scattering than NIR LiDAR, making it less suitable for terrestrial applications.

The Litto3D® product [@shom_bathymetry_litto3d_bzh_2018_2021] provides a high-resolution bathymetric and topographic map in coastal areas, created using LiDAR technologies. During airborne missions, the system captures terrestrial and submerged terrain features with exceptional precision. The topographic LiDAR achieves spatial resolution of 1 meter, with vertical accuracy up to 20 centimeters under optimal conditions, such as minimal atmospheric interference, stable flight paths, and favorable weather. The bathymetric LiDAR maps underwater landscapes to depths of approximately 70 m, depending on water transparency. This dual-mode capability is essential for modeling complex coastal environments, seamlessly integrating terrestrial and marine datasets. The airborne platform enables rapid data acquisition over large areas, overcoming challenges associated with ground-based or shipborne methods. The fusion methodology used by Litto3D® ensures the precise alignment of terrestrial and marine datasets, resolving inconsistencies in elevation data at land-water interfaces. The resulting unified dataset accurately represents coastal environments and support diverse scientific and practical applications such as coastal risk assessment and ecological studies. Distributed by the Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine [@shom] and the Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestiere [@ign], this dataset is open-source but currently available only for selected coastal regions in France.

In this study, LiDAR data were utilized in **Chapter 4** using a drone-borne NIR LiDAR system. These data were employed to evaluate the elevation and slope of mudflats in French and Spanish estuaries and to map the spatial distribution of the invasive red macroalga *Gracilaria vermiculophylla*. In **Chapter 5**, the Litto3D product was used along with a water height dataset to assess the emersion time of seagrass meadows in Quiberon, France, during low tide. Since this thesis is focuses on intertidal environement mapping, field campaigns are conducted during low tide to ensure optimal conditions for the effective use of NIR LiDAR providing unobstructed access to exposed intertidal zones.

### Passive Remote Sensing

Passive remote sensing is a method of collecting data about the Earth's surface or atmosphere by measuring naturally emitted or sunlight-reflected electromagnetic radiation without actively transmitting signals. This technique relies on energy sources external to the instrument, such as sunlight for optical and near-infrared sensors or Earth's thermal emissions for thermal infrared sensors.

Passive remote sensing is widely utilized in spaceborne satellite missions and has played a pivotal role in programs developed by major space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). For instance, the Sentinel-2 which provides ESA's highest spatial resolution imagery,  employs passive sensors. Data measured by these sensors have been applied to monitor land cover, vegetation dynamics and coastal and in land water environments.

As sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with various gases and particles altering its properties at specific wavelength. These interactions include scattering, absorption, and refraction. Scattering occurs when atmospheric molecules and aerosols disperse light in different directions, with shorter wavelengths like blue light being more strongly affected. Absorption result from atmospheric constituents such as ozone, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, which absorb energy at specific wavelengths, reducing the intensity of the transmitted light that reaches the Earth's surface. Refraction occurs as light changes direction and speed while passing through atmosphere layers with varying densities.

When sunlight reaches Earth's surface, it exhibits several behaviors, depending on the surface properties and the angle of incidence. These behaviors include:

-   Absorption: The light is absorbed by the surface, converting it into heat or another form of energy. This process varies based on the biogeochemical characteristics of the surface, with darker surfaces typically absorbing more light.

-   Transmission: The light passes through the surface, entering a different medium, such as water or transparent materials. The extent of transmission depends on the material’s transparency and refractive index.

-   Reflection: The light that is neither absorbed nor transmitted is redirected back in the opposite direction. The amount of reflection depends on the surface's albedo, with bright surfaces like snow reflecting more light compared to darker surfaces such as forests.

Only reflected light can be detected by spaceborne sensors. The most used metric in passive remote sensing, to quantify electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is reflectance ($R$). $R$ is typically measured as the ratio of upwelling radiance $L_u$ to downwelling radiance $L_d$ (@eq-reflectance). $L$ is definied as the radiant intensity per unit of projected area in a specified direction and is expressed in units of W.m^-2^.sr^-1^. $R$ however is dimensionless. 

$$
R(\lambda) = \frac{L_u(\lambda)}{L_d(\lambda)}
$${#eq-reflectance}

$R$ is defined for each wavelength as a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that all light has been absorbed or transmitted by the target, while a value of 1 indicates that all light has been reflected.

```

$R$ at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA), i.e., the magnitude directly measured by spaceborne or airborne sensors contains signals originating from both the atmosphere and the Earth's surface. Therefore, to study targets located on the Earth's surface, $R_{TOA}$ must undergo atmospheric correction processing to transform it into Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) $R$, which represents the intrinsic reflectance properties of the surface target. Precise $R_{BOA}$ is crucial for accurately analyzing surface characteristics and for applications like vegetation monitoring, water quality assessment, and land cover classification.

One of the most basic atmospheric correction methods is the "black pixel" method, which assumes that all the signal retrieved over optically deep waters originates entirely from the atmosphere. This information is then used to correct the reflectance across the entire scene. However, this method requires the presence of optically deep water tragets within the scene and assumes uniform aerosol concentrations across the scene. Such assumption may be inaccurate, particularly for satellites with a wide field of view, such as MODIS, where a single image can cover a swath of 2,330 km. Limitations to this technique arise also when the target of study is a water body itself. These limitations highlight the need for more advanced correction techniques that account for spatial variability in atmospheric properties.

To address these challenges, sophisticated atmospheric correction algorithms tailored to specific sensors and study areas have been developed. These algorithms account for atmospheric scattering, absorption, and path radiance contributions by leveraging radiative transfer models, auxiliary atmospheric data, and sometimes *in situ* measurements. For example, data of the ESA constellation Sentinel-2 can be processed using Sen2Cor, a correction algorithm designed to produce $R_{BOA}$ by incorporating atmospheric parameters such as water vapor, aerosols, and ozone concentrations. Additionally, some atmospheric correction methods are customized for specific targets, for example, algorithms specifically designed for water bodies, such as POLYMER [@steinmetz2011atmospheric] or ACOLITE [@vanhellemont2018atmospheric].

$R_{BOA}$ provides information regarding light reflected by the target across various wavelengths. This phenomenon, referred to as the spectral signature, is a unique feature of each target type. Spectral signatures contain data about the physical and chemical properties of surfaces, forming the basis for remote sensing applications. By analyzing spectral signatures, its possible to identify and classify surface types, as well as derive insights into environmental changes and land-use dynamics. For example, Chlorophyll-a (Chla), a pigment found in all vegetation, plays a key role in defining the spectral signature of plant life. Chla absorbs light in specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in the blue region around 440 nm and the red region near 675 nm. Consequently, healty vegetation exhibits a spectral signature with low $R$ at 440 and 675 nm. Variations in physiological states and vegetations types result in different spectral patterns, enabling their differentiation and monitoring of ecological conditions over time (@fig-Spectral_signature).

```

Spectral indices are mathematical combinations of reflectance values at specific wavelengths, designed to maximize particular surface characteristics with simple processing. Vegetation indices, for example, leverage the distinct reflectance patterns of photosynthetic pigments. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used index based on the normalised difference between $R$ in the NIR and red. It is calculated as:

$$
NDVI = \frac{R(NIR)-R(Red)}{R(NIR)+R(Red)}
$${#eq-NDVI}

where $R(NIR)$ is the reflectance in the infrared region arround 800 nm and $R(Red)$ is the reflectance in the red region arround 665 nm.

NDVI values range from -1 to 1, with negative values indicating water and higher positive values corresponding to dense healthy vegetation. While NDVI serves as a proxy for vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity, its interpretation can be complex in heterogeneous environments, such as areas with overlapping vegetation types or substrates.
Some studies propose a simple classification of NDVI based on thresholds to differentiate between different types of habitats or vegetations [@meleder2003cartographie]. While this simple first approximation can be useful for delimitating contrasting types of targets, establishing thresholds depends on specific sensor characteristics and this technique often fails in mapping vegetation types with similar pigment content or highly heterogeneous targets. More sophisticated techniques that utilize a greater amount of spectral information are required in such situation [@oiry2021using] 

$R_{BOA}$ can be used to identify key absorption features of chemical compounds of the traget, by applying derivative analysis to the spectral signature. The second derivative of the $R$ is utilized to enhance the detection of subtle pigment or mineral absorption features. By analyzing the second derivative, these small features are amplified, allowing for more precise identification of pigment presence and estimation of their concentrations. This approach is particularly effective for identifying accessory pigments that have weaker absorption features compared to chlorophyll-a.

#### Remote Sensing resolutions
##### Spectral and Radiometric resolution

The detection of pigments absorption feature necessitate to measure light reflectance at almost each wavelength. However this capacity measure the spectral signature in details depends on the spectra resolution of the sensor used to make the measure. 

Spectral resolution is a critical parameter of remote sensing sensors, defined by three main components: the number of spectral bands, the bandwidth (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM), and the spectral sampling interval. A sensor with higher spectral resolution can differentiate between closely spaced wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum, enabling precise characterization of spectral features.

Remote sensing sensors are generally classified into two categories based on their spectral resolution: multispectral sensors and hyperspectral sensors.
Multispectral sensors are characterized by a limited number of broad spectral bands. These bands cover wide portions of the spectrum, with a bandwidth generally exceeding 20 nm. The spectral sampling interval is relatively large, resulting in a coarser spectral resolution that provides a broad overview of the spectral characteristics of a scene. In contrast, hyperspectral sensors are equipped with hundreds of narrow, contiguous spectral bands. These bands are separated by small spectral sampling intervals, often just a few nanometers, which results in a much finer spectral resolution. This fine resolution allows for the detailed measurement of spectral signatures, capturing subtle variations in absorption features and spectral shapes. The difference in spectral resolution between these two categories significantly impacts the ability of the sensor to analyze complex spectral data. Hyperspectral sensors, with their narrow bands and fine sampling intervals, provide a continuous spectral profile that enables precise discrimination of unique spectral properties, such as pigment absorption. Multispectral sensors, while less detailed, are efficient for general spectral analyses where fine discrimination is not required.
Another specification of sensor regarding their ability to measure spectral signature is the radiometric resolution. It refers to the sensor's ability to measure and differentiate variations in the intensity of electromagnetic radiation. It is defined by the number of discrete levels, or bits, used to represent the energy recorded for each pixel in an image. Higher radiometric resolution enables finer distinctions in brightness levels, which is particularly important for detecting subtle differences in reflectance and ensuring accurate analysis of surface features. For example, an 8-bit sensor can record 256 levels of intensity, while a 12-bit sensor can capture 4,096 levels, providing greater detail and dynamic range in the captured imagery. 

##### Spatial resolution 

Spatial resolution, defined as the smallest discernible detail a sensor can detect on Earth's surface, is another fundamental characteristic of remote sensing sensors. It is typically represented by the ground area covered by a single pixel in an image and is influenced by the sensor’s instantaneous field of view (IFOV), which determines the angle of view and, consequently, the ground area visible to the sensor. A smaller IFOV or lower sensor altitude results in finer spatial resolution, enabling the detection of smaller features. For the same IFOV, sensors mounted on satellites can cover larger areas compared to those on drone, albeit with reduced detail.

Spatial resolution can range widely depending on the research objective and sensor platform. For instance, moderate-resolution sensors like MODIS aboard Terra and Aqua capture data at spatial resolutions of 250 meters, 500 meters, and 1 kilometer, making them suitable for large-scale environmental monitoring. In contrast, Sentinel-2 provides higher spatial resolutions—10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for red-edge and shortwave infrared bands, and 60 meters for atmospheric correction bands—facilitating detailed observations for applications such as agriculture and land-use mapping. At the finer end, high-resolution sensors on platforms like Pleiades-Neo achieve sub-meter resolutions (e.g., 30 cm per pixel), ideal for precise Earth observations.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with high-resolution cameras, offer even finer spatial resolutions, often down to a few centimeters, even millimeters, depending on flight altitude and sensor specifications. This ultra-high resolution is particularly advantageous for site-specific analyses, such as precision agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and detailed terrain modeling. However, such high resolution requires increased data storage and processing capacity, illustrating the trade-off between detail and operational feasibility.

In scenarios involving mixed vegetation types or intricate landscape features, coarse-resolution sensors may fail to capture fine-scale heterogeneity, limiting the accuracy of ecological or land-use analyses. Conversely, high-resolution imagery excels in such contexts but demands significant computational resources. Selecting the appropriate spatial resolution depends on specific research objectives and the spatial scale of the phenomena under investigation, underscoring the necessity of aligning sensor capabilities with study requirements.

##### Temporal Resolutions

Another key characteristic of remote sensing sensors is their temporal resolution, defined as the time interval between successive image acquisitions over the same study site. Temporal resolution is critical for monitoring dynamic environments, such as coastal ecosystems, where conditions can change rapidly due to tides, weather events, or human activity.

Temporal resolution varies significantly depending on the sensor's design and mission. For example, the Sentinel-2 constellation, composed of two satellites, offers a temporal resolution of 5 days at the equator. This revisit time improves to approximately 3 days at higher latitudes, such as in France, due to the overlap in satellite paths. Such frequent revisits make Sentinel-2 an excellent choice for applications requiring consistent monitoring, such as vegetation health assessments, sediment transport studies, or vegetation phenology estimations.
Certain missions, like Sentinel-3, achieve even shorter revisit times. Equipped with sensors designed for ocean and land monitoring, Sentinel-3 provides near-daily coverage, making it particularly suited for applications that require high temporal frequency, such as tracking phytoplankton blooms, which can appear and disappear within a few days, or surface temperature variations. This capability is crucial for capturing fast-evolving phenomena and ensuring timely data delivery for decision-making.

The temporal resolution of a satellite sensor may vary from hours to days, depending on whether the platform orbit is geostationary or sun-synchronous. Geostationary satellites provide continuous coverage over a fixed location, while sun-synchronous orbits follow sun illumination, allowing image acquisition at the same time of the day for a location. This consistency is particularly important for visible-infrared sensors, as it ensures usable images and maximizes the temporal resolution of the sensor by avoiding night-time acquisitions. On the other hand, airborne platforms exhibit more variable temporal resolutions, ranging from days to years, depending on mission planning.

Usually, temporal resolution is highly dependent on the spatial resolution of the sensor. Higher spatial resolution often corresponds to lower temporal resolution, although geostationary platforms and pointable sensors can be exceptions to this trend.

In contrast, some sensors are operated on-demand, with data acquisition triggered directly by the user. This is particularly characteristic of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and specialized satellite missions like Pleiades or PRISMA. While these systems may lack consistent temporal archives for a given study site, they provide unmatched flexibility for high-resolution data collection. Such sensors are invaluable for addressing specific research objectives, including acquiring detailed imagery immediately after extreme weather events or capturing localized features with high spatial precision, complementing routine satellite-based monitoring programs.

#### A story of trade off

Remote sensing involves inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and coverage area, which influence the suitability of sensors for different applications (@fig-ResolutionSatellite). High spatial resolution sensors, capable of capturing fine-scale details, are essential for precise tasks like urban infrastructure mapping or site-specific ecological studies. In coastal environments, high-resolution sensors are invaluable for identifying small-scale features such as intertidal vegetation patterns, sediment deposition dynamics, or the mapping of coral reef health. However, these sensors typically have lower temporal resolution and smaller coverage areas, limiting their utility for monitoring dynamic or widespread phenomena, such as tracking algal bloom events across entire coastal regions.

```

In contrast, sensors with coarser spatial resolution offer extensive coverage and higher revisit frequencies, making them ideal for tracking large-scale environmental changes. For coastal areas, these sensors can effectively monitor phenomena such as sea surface temperature variability, coastal erosion trends, and seasonal changes in primary productivity over larger geographic extents. For example, instruments like MODIS or VIIRS are well-suited for observing ocean color and chlorophyll concentrations, which are critical for understanding broader ecosystem health in coastal zones.

Intermediate-resolution sensors provide a compromise, offering sufficient detail for regional studies while maintaining adequate temporal resolution for periodic monitoring. These are particularly useful for applications such as mapping coastal vegetation transitions, estuarine dynamics, and changes in sediment plumes from rivers into the ocean over time. Instruments like Sentinel-2 or Landsat provide this balance, making them key assets for monitoring coastal ecosystems at scales relevant to regional management.

The selection of an appropriate sensor depends on the specific requirements of the study, balancing the need for detail, frequency, and geographic extent. Coastal zone management, for instance, often benefits from using a combination of sensors to capture both fine-scale spatial patterns and broader temporal trends, ensuring comprehensive monitoring of these dynamic environments.

<!-- Finally, a distinction can be made between high-altitude remote sensing and low-altitude remote sensing. Low-altitude remote sensing refers to the acquisition of spectral signatures at a distance of no more than 120 meters from the target, in compliance with European regulations on the maximum flight height for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This contrasts with high-altitude remote sensing, which involves plane-borne and space-borne sensors. The distinction is important due to significant differences in calibration methods for reflectance measurements, as well as variations in temporal, and above all, spatial resolution. -->

<!-- Reflectance calibration methods differ significantly between satellite-based remote sensing and in situ measurements using a Spectralon panel. For satellite sensors, reflectance calibration relies on pre-launch laboratory calibration and post-launch vicarious calibration, which uses known surface targets or atmospheric correction algorithms to account for sensor degradation, atmospheric effects, and viewing geometry. In contrast, in situ calibration with a Spectralon panel involves direct measurement of reflected light from a calibrated reference target with known reflectance properties, typically conducted under controlled conditions near the target area. This method ensures precise ground-truth data, providing high accuracy for reflectance measurements by eliminating the influence of atmospheric scattering and absorption, which are significant factors in satellite-based calibration. -->

<!-- Temporal resolution, defined as the time interval between successive image acquisitions over the same study site, varies significantly between low-altitude and high-altitude sensors. Satellites used for Earth observation are typically placed in low heliosynchronous orbits, allowing them to regularly revisit the same area of the Earth. For instance, the Sentinel-2 constellation offers a temporal resolution of 5 days at the equator, which decreases to as little as 3 days at higher latitudes, such as in France. Certain missions, like the Sentinel-3 constellation, achieve even shorter revisit times, often less than a day. In contrast, low-altitude sensors are generally operated on-demand, with data acquisition often initiated directly by the user. -->

<!-- Spatial resolution, defined as the ground area represented by a single pixel, differs significantly between low-altitude and high-altitude sensors. Satellite remote sensing can cover vast areas, often spanning millions of square kilometers, and capture data at the scale of entire countries in a single image. The spatial resolution of a sensor is directly influenced by its field of view, and while some satellites achieve resolutions as fine as 30 cm per pixel (e.g., Pleiades-Neo), this can pose challenges for accurately mapping complex ecosystems. For example, in scenarios involving mixed vegetation types, the inability to capture fine-scale heterogeneity can limit the accuracy of analyses. -->

<!-- In such challenging scenarios, low-altitude remote sensing offers a complementary approach by acquiring millions of pixels over smaller areas, achieving spatial resolutions at the millimeter scale. This level of detail enables more precise mapping of complex and heterogeneous ecosystems. -->

<!-- As a fundamental aspect of remote sensing, the principles introduced in this section will be applied in each subsequent chapter of this work. -->

### Remote Sensing applied to Coastal monitoring

Coastal environments represent highly dynamic and sensitive ecosystems shaped by complex interactions between natural processes and human activities. Remote sensing technologies are crucial for monitoring these regions, providing detailed data on shoreline erosion, habitat degradation, sediment dynamics, and water quality. High-resolution satellite imagery and drone-based platforms facilitate the detection of fine-scale changes in intertidal zones, mangroves, coral reefs, and other critical coastal habitats. These observations enable the quantification of spatial and temporal variations, informing evidence-based strategies for conservation and sustainable management.

Regulatory frameworks, such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), emphasize the need for regular mapping of marine habitats to monitor ecological health. These directives utilize habitat diversity as a bioindicator of coastal and estuarine water quality [@borja2013good ; @zoffoli2021decadal].

Satellite remote sensing has emerged as a promising tool for studying essential biodiversity variables in these habitats [@pereira2013essential ; @skidmore2015environmental]. Remote sensing offers several advantages over in situ sampling: repeated monitoring over large-scale coverage, high-frequency data acquisition, enabling seasonal and phenological studies, reduced costs and logistical challenges compared to field surveys, reconstruction of past conditions when used long time-series.

However, past and current satellite missions lack optimal technical specifications (spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution) for full operational capability [@muller10satellite]. For some habitats, multispectral resolution may be adequate under certain conditions [@zoffoli2020sentinel], although risks of classification errors remain. For others, higher spectral resolution is necessary to distinguish taxonomically distinct groups of organisms [@fyfe2003spatial ; @launeau2018microphytobenthos ; @meleder2018microphytobenthos]. Identification relies partly on the presence of visible absorption bands associated with photosynthetic and accessory pigments, which can be detected and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography [@meleder2005spatio ; @meleder2003spectrometric ; @bargain2013seasonal ; @jesus2014spectral].

## Overview

Discriminating between different types of intertidal vegetation using remote sensing poses significant challenges due to overlapping spectral signature in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions caused by similar pigment compositions. This issue is particularly pronounced when comparing green macroalgae and seagrass. In addition to chlorophyll-a, a pigment found in all vegetal cells, both green macroalgae and seagrass share the same accessory pigments such as chlorophyll-b and carotenoids. These shared pigments pronounce analogous reflectance patterns, making it difficult to differentiate between these vegetation types using conventional remote sensing techniques, especially in heterogenous habitats where these species often co exist. Despite these challenges, advances in spectral resolution and machine learning provide avenues for improved classification.

**Chapter 2** establishes the foundation by presenting a proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the feasibility of distinguising different types of vegetation using remote sensing. It demonstrates that this technique can effectively separate green macroalgae from seagrasses. By employing both multi- and hyperspectral datasets, the study identifies the number of spectral bands and specific wavelengths that maximize classification accuracy, showcasing the potential of remote sensing for detailed habitat mapping.

Building upon the proof of concept, **Chapter 3** focuses on the development of a robust algorithm called DISCOV v1.0, capable of automating the discrimination of green macrophytes in heterogeneous intertidal habitats. Utilizing high-resolution multispectral drone imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, this chapter addresses the spatial complexity of these environments. The algorithm's validation across diverse geographic and ecological settings ensures its applicability beyond the initial study sites. This advancement underscores the critical role of cutting-edge remote sensing technologies in ecological monitoring.

In **Chapter 4**, the methodology evolves to include red macroalgae, specifically targeting the invasive species *Gracilaria vermiculophylla*. By updating the algorithm in its v2.0, this study extends its application to a different taxonomic group, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of the approach. Additionally, this chapter integrates LiDAR-based topographical data to examine the relationship between habitat characteristics and macroalgal distribution. The insights gained from mapping and modeling the spatial dynamics of *G. vermiculophylla* provide valuable implications for managing invasive species and conserving native biodiversity.

Finally, **Chapter 5** examines the physiological impacts of environmental stressors, specifically marine and atmospheric heatwaves, on seagrass reflectance. Through controlled laboratory experiments and field validations, this chapter highlights the spectral responses of *Zostera noltei* under heatwave conditions. Well-established spectral indices such as the NDVI and GLI are employed, and a new index, the Seagrass Heat Shock Index (SHSI), is developed to specifically identify heatwave-impacted seagrasses. These indices provide metrics to detect and quantify stress-induced changes. These findings emphasize the role of remote sensing in assessing the resilience and vulnerability of intertidal ecosystems under climate change.
