## General Introduction 
### Coastal Environment 
### Remote sensing applied to Coastal environments 
## Overview 

Discriminating green macroalgae from seagrasses throught remote sensing poses significant challenges due to their overlapping spectral signatures and similar pigment compositions, particularly in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. Both vegetation types share key pigments such as chlorophyll-a and carotenoids, which lead to analogous reflectance patterns. This similarity complicates their differentiation using conventional remote sensing techniques, especially when these species coexist within heterogeneous habitats. Despite these challenges, advances in spectral resolution and machine learning provide avenues for improved classification.

Chapter 2 establishes the foundation by presenting a proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the feasibility of discriminating green macroalgae from seagrasses in intertidal zones using remote sensing. By employing both multi- and hyperspectral datasets, the study elucidates the specific wavelengths and spectral resolutions that maximize classification accuracy, showcasing the potential of remote sensing for detailed habitat mapping.

Building upon the proof of concept, Chapter 3 focuses on the development of a robust algorithm capable of automating the discrimination of green macrophytes in heterogeneous intertidal habitats. Utilizing high-resolution multispectral drone imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, this chapter addresses the spatial complexity of these environments. The algorithmâ€™s validation across diverse geographic and ecological settings ensures its applicability beyond the initial study sites. This advancement underscores the critical role of cutting-edge remote sensing technologies in ecological monitoring.

In Chapter 4, the methodology evolves to include red macroalgae, specifically targeting the invasive species Gracilaria vermiculophylla. By adapting the algorithm from Chapter 3, this study extends its application to a different taxonomic group, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of the approach. Additionally, this chapter integrates LiDAR-based topographical data to examine the relationship between habitat characteristics and macroalgal distribution. The insights gained from mapping and modeling the spatial dynamics of G. vermiculophylla provide valuable implications for managing invasive species and conserving native biodiversity.

Finally, Chapter 5 examines the physiological impacts of environmental stressors, specifically marine and atmospheric heatwaves, on seagrass reflectance. Through controlled laboratory experiments and field validations, this chapter highlights the spectral responses of Zostera noltei under heatwave conditions. Well-established spectral indices such as the NDVI and GLI are employed, and a new index, the Seagrass Heat Shock Index (SHSI), is developed to specifically identify heatwave-impacted seagrasses. These indices provide metrics to detect and quantify stress-induced changes. These findings emphasize the role of remote sensing in assessing the resilience and vulnerability of intertidal ecosystems under climate change.
