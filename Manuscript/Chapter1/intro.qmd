## General Introduction 

Marine coastal zones are among the most densely populated regions globally, serving as critical hubs for economic activity, transportation, and tourism. These areas support diverse ecosystems and provide essential resources. Additionally, they play a pivotal role in global trade and commerce while also offering cultural and recreational value. However, their popularity and utility make them highly vulnerable to environmental pressures such as pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change impacts like sea-level rise and coastal erosion. Effective management and sustainable practices are crucial to preserving their ecological integrity and ensuring long-term viability.

Marine vegetative habitats in intertidal zones that are exposed at low tide (such as seagrass meadows, microphytobenthos, and macroalgae) are significantly impacted by human activities. Seagrass meadows are under threat due to various anthropogenic activities [@mckenzie2020global], microphytobenthos are affected by the global decline of intertidal mudflats [@murray2019global], and areas colonized by macroalgae may be reduced due to the expansion of wild oysters [@le2016hyperspectral].

These habitats provide vital ecological functions, including coastal erosion protection through root stabilization and sediment trapping (**refs**), mitigation of eutrophication effects by absorbing excess nutrients and improving water quality (**refs**), atmospheric CO2 fixation, contributing to carbon sequestration and combating climate change (**refs**), serving as biodiversity hotspots that support unique flora and fauna, providing feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for various species. Despite their ecological significance, intertidal zones, particularly mudflats, are challenging to access, and traditional field sampling methods are too time- and labor-intensive to allow repeated observations over large areas. This limitation underscores the need for advanced monitoring technologies to better assess and protect these habitats.

Intertidal habitats, at the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, face significant pressures from both anthropogenic activities and natural forces affecting both realms. Human-induced threats include coastal development, pollution, overfishing, and habitat modification, which degrade these ecosystems and diminish the valuable ecosystem services they provide. Meanwhile, natural factors such as storms, sea-level rise, climatic extreme events and climate change exacerbate these pressures, altering the structure function, and resilience of intertidal habitats. Despite their ecological importance in supporting biodiversity, providing coastal protection, and contributing to nutrient cycling, intertidal habitats remain highly vulnerable. Addressing these challenges requires robust management practices, targeted conservation strategies, and ongoing monitoring to ensure their sustainability and resilience against future pressures.

### Coastal Environment 

Coastal environments represent a complex and dynamic interface between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, characterized by exceptional biodiversity, diverse geomorphological structures, and significant socio-economic relevance. These regions span a continuum that includes beaches, dunes, estuaries, deltas, tidal flats, wetlands, and lagoons, each shaped by a combination of natural processes and anthropogenic influences [@laignel2023observation].

The coastal zone encompasses areas where terrestrial and marine domains intersect, including environments influenced by tidal flows, wave dynamics, and riverine inputs. This transition zone can extend from a few hundred meters inland to several kilometers offshore, depending on local topography and ecological gradients. It incorporates upper shores and dunes, intertidal zones, periodically submerged and exposed by tidal activity, as well as subtidal zones that remain submerged permanently (@fig-CoastalHabitat ; @laignel2023observation).

As one of the most dynamic and multifaceted regions on Earth, coastal environments host highly diverse and productive habitats. These include both natural ecosystems and managed systems that underpin key economic sectors and urban centers. The functionality of many coastal ecosystems is intrinsically linked to land-sea interactions, as observed in deltas and estuaries. These environments exhibit steep gradients in salinity—from freshwater to hypersaline—and energy levels, ranging from low-energy wetlands to high-energy, wave-dominated shorelines. On a broader scale, coastal regions encompass a spectrum of climatic zones, from tropical to polar, each characterized by unique biogeophysical processes and features. However, these areas are also exposed to a variety of land-based and marine hazards, including storms, tropical cyclones, storm surges, tsunamis, riverine flooding, shoreline erosion, and biohazards such as algal blooms and pollutants.

Coastal ecosystems provide a range of ecosystem services that are fundamental to environmental sustainability and human well-being. These ecosystems function as natural barriers against storm surges and coastal flooding, thereby mitigating the impacts of such hazards on inland regions and safeguarding human lives and infrastructure. They support significant biodiversity, serving as critical habitats and breeding grounds for numerous species, including commercially valuable fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms that sustain global fisheries. Coastal vegetation, including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration by capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus contributing to climate change mitigation.

Beyond their role in climate regulation, coastal ecosystems enhance water quality by filtering pollutants, sediments, and excess nutrients, thereby maintaining healthier marine and estuarine systems. These ecosystems are integral to nutrient cycling, ensuring the continued productivity of adjacent marine environments. Additionally, they provide substantial cultural, educational, and recreational opportunities, drawing global attention and fostering an intrinsic human connection to nature. This societal value contributes directly to local and regional economies through industries such as tourism, artisanal fishing, and related enterprises. Furthermore, coastal ecosystems supply essential natural resources, including seafood and plant-based materials, while supporting sustainable aquaculture practices that promote global food security and bolster local livelihoods. Collectively, these functions highlight the indispensable ecological and economic importance of coastal ecosystems. 

Coastal areas are among the most significant regions for human habitation due to their strategic geographic position, resource availability, and economic opportunities. Currently, approximately 2 billion people reside within 50 kilometers of coastlines, with nearly 1 billion living within 10 kilometers. This represents nearly 15% of the global population occupying only 4% of the Earth’s inhabitable landmass. Projections indicate that coastal populations will continue to rise, potentially reaching 2.9 billion by 2100 under various socioeconomic scenarios. These areas offer critical resources such as seafood and freshwater, while their moderate climates often support agricultural activities and other forms of sustainable land use. Proximity to oceans and rivers enables robust trade, transportation, and industrial growth, positioning many coastal cities as pivotal economic hubs on a global scale. The ecological and cultural roles of coastal landscapes further contribute to their appeal, attracting populations for both settlement and economic activities.

Human utilization of coastal areas spans a range of economic and social activities that highlight both the benefits and challenges of these environments. [Coastal tourism](https://blue-economy-observatory.ec.europa.eu/eu-blue-economy-sectors/coastal-tourism_en) is a significant driver of economic growth, particularly in regions like the European Union (EU). In 2021, the EU's coastal tourism sector generated approximately €49.9 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) and employed around 1.9 million people. [Coastal fishing](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/aquafarming-becomes-main-global-source-fish-un-food-agency-says-2024-06-07) and aquaculture are vital components of the global economy, providing employment to millions and contributing significantly to food security. In 2022, the combined global production of fisheries and aquaculture reached a record 223.2 million tonnes, with aquaculture alone producing an unprecedented 130.9 million tonnes. Notably, for the first time, aquaculture surpassed wild capture in aquatic animal production, accounting for 51% of the total. Additionally, [maritime shipping](https://maritime-union.org/how-much-trade-is-maritime/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is the backbone of international trade, with approximately 80% of global trade by volume and over 70% by value transported via sea routes. This extensive reliance on maritime transport underscores the critical importance of coastal infrastructure, including ports and harbors, in facilitating the movement of goods worldwide. 

However, the intensive exploitation of coastal environments for human activities, has led to significant ecological challenges.

For instance, marine shipping contributes about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure projected to rise by up to 50% by mid-century if stringent measures are not implemented [@IMO2020GHG]. Additionally, shipping activities lead to marine pollution, including oil spills, ballast water discharge and underwater noise affecting marine life. Oil spills remain a critical environmental concern due to their devastating and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems. These spills contaminate water, harm marine biodiversity, and disrupt food chains, often leading to severe economic losses in fisheries and tourism. In 2023, 10 oil spills were recorded globally, releasing over 2,000 metric tons of oil into the environment, including one major spill exceeding 700 metric tons. While historical trends show a reduction in large spills, from over 20 per year in the 1970s to about 1.3 per year in recent decades, incidents such as the December 2024 Kerch Strait spill, where 3,700 tons of oil were released, underscore the persistent and significant risks. Such events highlight the necessity for stringent preventive measures and rapid response mechanisms to mitigate the ongoing threat posed by oil spills to marine environments. Ballast water discharge represents a significant vector for the introduction of invasive aquatic species into new environments. Approximately 40% of non-indigenous aquatic species in ecosystems have been linked to ballast water release. Underwater noise pollution from shipping activities poses a growing threat to marine life, particularly cetaceans such as whales and dolphins. Elevated noise levels can disrupt communication, navigation, and feeding behaviors, leading to increased stress and altered migration patterns. Chronic exposure to underwater noise can also result in physical harm and population-level impacts. 
One significant impact of fishing and aquaculture on coastal habitats is the degradation of critical ecosystems such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves. Destructive fishing practices, including bottom trawling and the use of dynamite or cyanide, physically damage the seafloor and associated habitats, resulting in biodiversity loss and the disruption of ecological functions. The expansion of aquaculture operations often necessitates the conversion of coastal wetlands, particularly mangroves, into fish or shrimp ponds. This land-use change reduces the availability of essential nursery habitats for marine species and diminishes the ecosystem services provided by mangroves, such as carbon sequestration, shoreline stabilization, and water filtration. Additionally, aquaculture activities contribute to nutrient enrichment and pollution in adjacent waters through the release of uneaten feed, feces, and chemical additives, exacerbating eutrophication and altering benthic community structures. Another significant concern is the introduction of alien invasive species into the environment through aquaculture, which can disrupt local ecosystems and biodiversity. This issue will be further explored in Chapter 4. 
Coastal tourism exerts a profound influence on ecosystem integrity, often driving substantial environmental degradation through mechanisms such as habitat destruction, pollution, and resource overexploitation. The construction and expansion of tourist infrastructure frequently lead to the removal or fragmentation of critical habitats, including mangroves, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs, all of which play pivotal roles in maintaining biodiversity and safeguarding coastal resilience. Furthermore, the rapid influx of visitors generates significant volumes of waste and untreated sewage, contributing to water quality deterioration and eutrophication, which disrupt aquatic ecosystems and alter trophic dynamics. The elevated demand for limited resources, notably freshwater and seafood, exacerbates ecological stress, leading to overharvesting and resource depletion. 


### Concepts of Remote sensing

Remote sensing (RS) defines the ability to retrieve information in a non-invasive way, without direct contact with the target. It relies on the propagation of signals, typically optical, acoustic, or microwave, between the target and the sensor. This technology is applied in a wide variety of fields, ranging from medical imaging to detect stem cells, to the analysis of the structure of the primordial universe [@zhu2021deep ; @aghanim2020resultats]. Remote sensing is integral to Earth observation (EO), where its methodologies facilitate large-scale and long-term data collection. Instruments on satellites, aircraft, and drones provide high-resolution imagery and measurements critical for monitoring environmental changes, mapping natural resources, and assessing land use patterns. These technologies enable systematic data collection over large areas and extended periods, supporting analyses such as deforestation, glacial melting, variations in ocean temperature, and land use mapping.

Coastal environments represent highly dynamic and sensitive ecosystems shaped by complex interactions between natural processes and human activities. Remote sensing technologies are crucial for monitoring these regions, providing detailed data on shoreline erosion, habitat degradation, sediment dynamics, and water quality. High-resolution satellite imagery and drone-based platforms facilitate the detection of fine-scale changes in intertidal zones, mangroves, coral reefs, and other critical coastal habitats. These observations enable the quantification of spatial and temporal variations, informing evidence-based strategies for conservation and sustainable management. 

The following sections examine two complementary approaches within the field of remote sensing for Earth observation: active and passive remote sensing. Through examples focused on coastal monitoring, these sections will introduce the remote sensing methodologies employed in this work while outlining their respective advantages and challenges. 

#### Active Remote Sensing, Exemple of the LiDAR

Active remote sensing is a technique in which a sensor emits its own energy—typically in the form of electromagnetic radiation—toward a target and measures the energy reflected or backscattered from that target. This method allows for the collection of data regardless of natural light conditions, enabling observations during both day and night and through various weather conditions. 

LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses laser light to measure distances to objects or surfaces. By emitting laser pulses and measuring the time it takes for them to reflect back from a target, LiDAR systems can create precise, three-dimensional representations of the environment.

LiDAR works by emitting a beam of light and measuring the time it takes for the beam to return to the sensor. This process not only calculates distance but can also capture the intensity of the returned signal. In many instances, multiple returns from a single pulse are measured, which allows for mapping the different heights of objects within the same x and y coordinates. This capability is particularly useful for applications such as mapping the heights of trees in a forest or measuring crop heights in agricultural fields. When the height of the ground cannot be measured, LiDAR data can only generate a digital surface model (DSM), which represents the topmost layer of the environment. However, if multiple returns are recorded, it becomes possible to create both a DSM and a digital terrain model (DTM), which represents the ground surface, by differentiating between surface and underlying layers. The difference between DSM and DTM can be uses to assess living stock or biomass.

Achieving accurate 3D measurements of a target using LiDAR technology requires an exceptional level of precision in assessing each parameter of the system. The quality of the final output depends on careful calibration and execution at every stage of the process. One of the critical steps is ensuring the precise timing of the laser beam's return after it reflects off the target. This timing directly determines the distance calculations that form the basis of the 3D structure.
Equally important is the accurate positioning of the LiDAR sensor, which is often mounted on a drone, aircraft, or satellite. The sensor’s x, y, and z coordinates must be continuously tracked with a high degree of precision. To achieve this, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning systems are commonly employed. These systems enhance the accuracy of the positioning data by providing real-time corrections to the sensor's GPS coordinates, ensuring minimal error and maintaining the integrity of the spatial measurements.
Without such stringent measures, the resulting LiDAR data is prone to errors that can lead to distorted and noisy representations of the mapped surface. These inaccuracies not only diminish the reliability of the data but also compromise its utility for detailed analysis and decision-making processes.

In coastal environment monitoring, LiDAR systems are distinguished by their emitted wavelengths, which dictate their performance and application. These systems are categorized into "topographic LiDAR" and "bathymetric LiDAR," each suited to specific tasks in coastal studies. Topographic LiDAR operates in the near-infrared spectrum (approximately 1000 nm), used for mapping terrestrial features such as beach contours, vegetation density, and man-made structures. Its ability to generate high-density point clouds stems from efficient operation at lower power. Unlike green LiDAR, near-infrared LiDAR does not require as much power, making it generally cheaper and smaller. These attributes allow topographic LiDAR systems to be easily mounted on drone platforms, enabling greater flexibility and accessibility for coastal monitoring. Conversely, bathymetric LiDAR, utilizing green wavelengths (~532 nm), penetrates water to reveal submerged landscapes, including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and shallow seabeds. While this capability is indispensable for underwater mapping, its effectiveness on land is hindered by atmospheric scattering.

Litto3D® [@shom_bathymetry_litto3d_bzh_2018_2021], distributed by the Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine [@shom] and the Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestiere [@ign], is an open-source dataset that exemplifies the integration of advanced remote sensing techniques to produce a seamless, high-resolution topographic model that bridges land and sea within France’s coastal regions. By employing both topographic and bathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technologies during airborne missions, the system captures terrestrial and submerged terrain features with exceptional precision. The topographic LiDAR operates at resolutions as fine as 1 meter, achieving vertical accuracy within 20 centimeters under optimal conditions, such as minimal atmospheric interference, stable flight paths, and favorable weather conditions, while the bathymetric LiDAR effectively maps underwater landscapes down to depths of approximately 70 meters, depending on water clarity, including factors such as turbidity, sediment load, and the presence of organic matter in the water column. This dual-mode capability is essential for modeling complex coastal environments, ensuring the seamless integration of terrestrial and marine datasets. The airborne platform enables rapid data acquisition over extensive areas, overcoming challenges associated with ground-based or shipborne methods. The fusion methodology employed by Litto3D® ensures the precise alignment of terrestrial and marine datasets, addressing the challenges of inconsistent elevation data at land-water interfaces. This process results in a unified and accurate representation of coastal environments. This dataset is well-suited for diverse scientific and practical applications, including coastal risk assessment and ecological studies.

In the present study, LiDAR data will be utilized in **Chapter 4** through a drone-borne infrared LiDAR system. This data will be employed to evaluate the elevation and slope of mudflats in French and Spanish estuaries and to map the spatial distribution of the invasive red macroalga *Gracilaria vermiculophylla*. In **Chapter 5**, the Litto3D product will be used in conjunction with a water height dataset to assess the emersion time of seagrass meadows in Quiberon, France, during low tide. As this thesis is focused on intertidal environement mapping, Field campaigns are conducted during low tide, as it provides optimal conditions for the effective use of Infrared LiDAR by ensuring unobstructed access to exposed intertidal zones. 

#### Passive Remote Sensing

In contrast to active remote sensing, passive remote sensing is a method of collecting data about the Earth's surface or atmosphere by measuring naturally emitted or reflected electromagnetic radiation without actively transmitting signals. This technique relies on external energy sources, such as sunlight, for optical and near-infrared sensors or Earth's thermal emissions for thermal infrared sensors. 

Passive remote sensing is commonly utilized in spaceborne satellite missions. It has been integral to numerous missions developed by major space agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). For instance, the Sentinel-2 mission by ESA employs passive sensors to capture high-resolution optical images, measuring sunlight reflected by Earth's surface at various wavelengths to monitor land and vegetation changes globally.

Sunlight travels approximately eight minutes from the Sun's surface to Earth, traversing the atmosphere upon arrival. The atmosphere, composed of various gases and particles, interacts with sunlight, altering its properties at specific wavelengths. These interactions include scattering, absorption, and refraction. Scattering occurs when atmospheric molecules and aerosols disperse light in different directions, often impacting shorter wavelengths like blue light more significantly. Absorption is caused by atmospheric constituents such as ozone, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, which absorb energy at particular wavelengths, reducing the intensity of the transmitted light. Refraction occurs as light changes direction and speed while passing through layers of the atmosphere with varying densities.

Once sunlight reaches Earth's surface, it exhibits several behaviors, depending on the surface properties and the angle of incidence. These behaviors include:
  
  -   Reflection: The light is redirected back into the atmosphere without being absorbed by the surface. The amount of reflection depends on the surface's albedo, with bright surfaces like snow reflecting more light compared to darker surfaces such as forests.

-   Absorption: The light is absorbed by the surface, converting it into heat or another form of energy. This process varies based on the material's absorptive properties and its color, with darker surfaces typically absorbing more light.

-   Transmission: The light passes through the surface, entering a different medium, such as water or transparent materials. The extent of transmission depends on the material's transparency and refractive index.

Only reflected light can be detected by spaceborne sensors, having undergone one final alteration by the atmosphere. The most commonly used metric in passive remote sensing is reflectance. Reflectance is typically defined as the ratio of reflected radiation to incoming radiation at a specific wavelength. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
R(\lambda) = \frac{L_r(\lambda)}{L_i(\lambda)}
$$
where: 

-   $R(\lambda)$ is the reflectance at the wavelength $\lambda$  
-   $L_r(\lambda)$ is the radiance reflected by the surface at wavelength $\lambda$ 
-   $L_i(\lambda)$ is the incident radiance (or irradiance) at wavelength $\lambda$

Reflectance is defined for each wavelength as a value between 0 and 1. A reflectance of 0 indicates that all light has been absorbed or transmitted by the target, while a reflectance of 1 indicates that all light has been reflected.

However, reflectance cannot be directly used as measured by spaceborne sensors, as it contains signals originating from both the atmosphere and the target. This reflectance is commonly referred to as Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. TOA reflectance is useful for applications such as assessing aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere or implementing cloud detection algorithms.

To study targets located on the Earth's surface, the atmospheric effects on reflectance must be corrected. Atmospheric correction algorithms are applied to transform TOA reflectance into surface or Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance, which represents the intrinsic reflectance properties of the surface target. BOA reflectance is crucial for accurately analyzing surface characteristics and for applications like vegetation monitoring, water quality assessment, and land cover classification, where precise surface reflectance values are essential.

One of the most basic atmospheric correction methods is the "black pixel" method, which assumes that all the signal retrieved from optically deep water is entirely due to atmospheric effects. This information is then used to correct the reflectance across the entire scene. However, this method requires the presence of optically deep water bodies within the scene and assumes uniform aerosol concentrations across the scene. Such assumptions may be inaccurate, particularly for satellites with a wide field of view, such as MODIS, where a single image can cover a swath of 2,330 km. These limitations highlight the need for more advanced correction techniques that account for spatial variability in atmospheric properties. 

To address these challenges, space agencies have developed sophisticated atmospheric correction algorithms tailored to specific sensors and study areas, accounting for atmospheric scattering, absorption, and path radiance contributions by leveraging radiative transfer models, auxiliary atmospheric data, and sometimes *in situ* measurements. For example, data of the ESA constellation Sentinel-2 can be processed using Sen2Cor, a correction algorithm designed to produce BOA reflectance by incorporating atmospheric parameters such as water vapor, aerosols, and ozone concentrations. These advanced algorithms often rely on radiative transfer simulations and use ancillary data from onboard sensors or external sources to improve accuracy. Additionally, some atmospheric correction methods are customized for specific applications, such as the ocean color community, which employs algorithms specifically designed for water bodies. PolyMER or ACOLITE, for instance, are widely used atmospheric correction model that enhances water-leaving radiance retrieval, making it highly effective for monitoring aquatic ecosystems. 

After atmospheric correction, BOA reflectance provides information regarding light reflected by the target at various wavelengths. This phenomenon, referred to as the spectral signature, is a unique feature of each target type. Spectral signatures contain data about the physical and chemical properties of surfaces, forming the basis for remote sensing applications. By analyzing spectral signatures, its possible to identify and classify surface types, as well as derive insights into environmental changes and land-use dynamics. For example, Chlorophyll-a, a pigment commonly found in vegetation, plays a key role in defining the spectral signature of plant life. Chlorophyll-a absorbs light in specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in the blue region around 430 nm and the red region near 665 nm. These absorption characteristics shape the spectral signature of vegetation, resulting in minimal reflectance in these wavelength ranges. Consequently, these spectral features are important indicators in remote sensing studies, enabling the differentiation of vegetation types, assessment of their physiological health, and monitoring of ecological conditions over time.

Spectral indices are mathematical combinations of reflectance values at specific wavelengths, designed to highlight particular surface characteristics. Vegetation indices, for example, leverage the distinct reflectance patterns of photosynthetic pigments. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used index based on the normalised difference between near-infrared (NIR) and red reflectance values. It is calculated as: 

$$
NDVI = \frac{R(NIR)-R(Red)}{R(NIR)+R(Red)}
$$

where $R(NIR)$ is the reflectance in the infrared region arround 800 nm and $R(Red)$ is the reflectance in the red region arround 665 nm. 

NDVI values range from -1 to +1, with negative values indicating water and higher positive values corresponding to denser vegetation. While NDVI serves as a proxy for vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity, its interpretation can be complex in heterogeneous environments, such as areas with overlapping vegetation types or substrates. **make a link with one of the objective of the thesis, that aims to develop new methods to distinguish vegetation, that doesn't rely only on threshold of spectral indices. [@oiry2021using]**. 

BOA reflectance can be used to identify key absorption features of chemical compounds of the traget, by applying derivative on the spectral signature. The second derivative of the reflectance spectrum is utilized to enhance the detection of subtle pigment absorption features. By analyzing the second derivative, small variations in reflectance due to specific pigments can be amplified, allowing for a more precise estimation of pigment concentrations and distribution. This approach is particularly effective for identifying accessory pigments that have weaker absorption features compared to chlorophyll-a.

-   **Speak about *in situ* spectroradiometry**

Finally, a distinction can be made between high-altitude remote sensing and low-altitude remote sensing. Low-altitude remote sensing refers to the acquisition of spectral signatures at a distance of no more than 120 meters from the target, in compliance with European regulations on the maximum flight height for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This contrasts with high-altitude remote sensing, which involves plane-borne and space-borne sensors. The distinction is important due to significant differences in calibration methods for reflectance measurements, as well as variations in temporal, and above all, spatial resolution. 

Reflectance calibration methods differ significantly between satellite-based remote sensing and in situ measurements using a Spectralon panel. For satellite sensors, reflectance calibration relies on pre-launch laboratory calibration and post-launch vicarious calibration, which uses known surface targets or atmospheric correction algorithms to account for sensor degradation, atmospheric effects, and viewing geometry. In contrast, in situ calibration with a Spectralon panel involves direct measurement of reflected light from a calibrated reference target with known reflectance properties, typically conducted under controlled conditions near the target area. This method ensures precise ground-truth data, providing high accuracy for reflectance measurements by eliminating the influence of atmospheric scattering and absorption, which are significant factors in satellite-based calibration.

Temporal resolution, defined as the time interval between successive image acquisitions over the same study site, varies significantly between low-altitude and high-altitude sensors. Satellites used for Earth observation are typically placed in low heliosynchronous orbits, allowing them to regularly revisit the same area of the Earth. For instance, the Sentinel-2 constellation offers a temporal resolution of 5 days at the equator, which decreases to as little as 3 days at higher latitudes, such as in France. Certain missions, like the Sentinel-3 constellation, achieve even shorter revisit times, often less than a day. In contrast, low-altitude sensors are generally operated on-demand, with data acquisition often initiated directly by the user. 

Spatial resolution, defined as the ground area represented by a single pixel, differs significantly between low-altitude and high-altitude sensors. Satellite remote sensing can cover vast areas, often spanning millions of square kilometers, and capture data at the scale of entire countries in a single image. The spatial resolution of a sensor is directly influenced by its field of view, and while some satellites achieve resolutions as fine as 30 cm per pixel (e.g., Pleiades-Neo), this can pose challenges for accurately mapping complex ecosystems. For example, in scenarios involving mixed vegetation types, the inability to capture fine-scale heterogeneity can limit the accuracy of analyses.

In such challenging scenarios, low-altitude remote sensing offers a complementary approach by acquiring millions of pixels over smaller areas, achieving spatial resolutions at the millimeter scale. This level of detail enables more precise mapping of complex and heterogeneous ecosystems.

As a fundamental aspect of remote sensing, the principles introduced in this section will be applied in each subsequent chapter of this work. 


#### Remote Sensing applied to Coastal monitoring

Regulatory frameworks, such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), emphasize the need for regular mapping of marine habitats to monitor ecological health. These directives utilize habitat diversity as a bioindicator of coastal and estuarine water quality [@borja2013good ; @zoffoli2021decadal].

Satellite remote sensing has emerged as a promising tool for studying essential biodiversity variables in these habitats [@pereira2013essential ; @skidmore2015environmental]. Remote sensing offers several advantages over in situ sampling: repeated monitoring over large-scale coverage, high-frequency data acquisition, enabling seasonal and phenological studies, reduced costs and logistical challenges compared to field surveys, reconstruction of past conditions when used long time-series.

However, past and current satellite missions lack optimal technical specifications (spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution) for full operational capability [@muller10satellite]. For some habitats, multispectral resolution may be adequate under certain conditions [@zoffoli2020sentinel], although risks of classification errors remain. For others, higher spectral resolution is necessary to distinguish taxonomically distinct groups of organisms [@fyfe2003spatial ; @launeau2018microphytobenthos ; @meleder2018microphytobenthos]. Identification relies partly on the presence of visible absorption bands associated with photosynthetic and accessory pigments, which can be detected and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography [@meleder2005spatio ; @meleder2003spectrometric ; @bargain2013seasonal ; @jesus2014spectral].

## Overview 

Discriminating between different types of intertidal vegetation using remote sensing poses significant challendes due to overlapping spectral signature in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions caused by similar pigment compositions. This issue is particularly pronounced when comparing green macroalgae and seagrass. In addition to chlorophyll-a, a pigment found in all vegetal cells, both green macroalgae and seagrass share the same accessory pigments such as chlorophyll-b and carotenoids. These shared pigments pronounce analogous reflectance patterns, making it difficult to differentiate between these vegetation types using conventional remote sensing techniques, espacially in heterogenous habitats where these species often co exist.Despite these challenges, advances in spectral resolution and machine learning provide avenues for improved classification.

**Chapter 2** establishes the foundation by presenting a proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the feasibility of distinguising different types of vegetation using remote sensing. It demonstrates that this technique can effectively separate green macroalgae from seagrasses. By employing both multi- and hyperspectral datasets, the study identifies the number of spectral bands and specific wavelengths that maximize classification accuracy, showcasing the potential of remote sensing for detailed habitat mapping.

Building upon the proof of concept, **Chapter 3** focuses on the development of a robust algorithm called DISCOV v1.0, capable of automating the discrimination of green macrophytes in heterogeneous intertidal habitats. Utilizing high-resolution multispectral drone imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, this chapter addresses the spatial complexity of these environments. The algorithm’s validation across diverse geographic and ecological settings ensures its applicability beyond the initial study sites. This advancement underscores the critical role of cutting-edge remote sensing technologies in ecological monitoring.

In **Chapter 4**, the methodology evolves to include red macroalgae, specifically targeting the invasive species *Gracilaria vermiculophylla*. By updating the algorithm in its v2.0, this study extends its application to a different taxonomic group, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of the approach. Additionally, this chapter integrates LiDAR-based topographical data to examine the relationship between habitat characteristics and macroalgal distribution. The insights gained from mapping and modeling the spatial dynamics of G. vermiculophylla provide valuable implications for managing invasive species and conserving native biodiversity.

Finally, **Chapter 5** examines the physiological impacts of environmental stressors, specifically marine and atmospheric heatwaves, on seagrass reflectance. Through controlled laboratory experiments and field validations, this chapter highlights the spectral responses of *Zostera noltei* under heatwave conditions. Well-established spectral indices such as the NDVI and GLI are employed, and a new index, the Seagrass Heat Shock Index (SHSI), is developed to specifically identify heatwave-impacted seagrasses. These indices provide metrics to detect and quantify stress-induced changes. These findings emphasize the role of remote sensing in assessing the resilience and vulnerability of intertidal ecosystems under climate change.
