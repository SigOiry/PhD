This work underscores the potential of RS technologies in addressing ecological challenges in intertidal zones, including the impacts of climate change, anthropogenic pressures, and habitat fragmentation. By demonstrating improved accuracy in habitat classification, from seagrass discrimination to IAS mapping, this work highlights the critical role of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing in obtaining explicit spatial distribution maps of the main taxonomic units of intertidal vegetation. Integrating ground-based, drone, and satellite observations proved pivotal in bridging spatial and temporal gaps, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and dynamics.
