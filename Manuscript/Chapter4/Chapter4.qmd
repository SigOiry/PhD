## Introduction

The introduction of Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems is one of the major threats to biodiversity worldwide. In particular, the proliferation and rapid spread of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) can radically change the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, requiring effective assessment and monitoring programs [@d15020161]. In Europe, 874 NIS have been introduced to the marine environment so far (i.e. until 2020) and it is expected that the rate of biological invasions will continue to increase in the coming years [@d14121077]. Macroalgae represent more than 40 % of the NIS introduced to Europe waters, with many species native to the Temperate Northern Pacific [@williams2007global].

Amongst all invasive macroalgae, *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* [@WoRMS303450] (original name *Gracilariopsis vermiculophylla* [@ohmi1956contributions]; also known as *Agarophyton vermiculophyllum* [@gurgel2018systematics]), has spread extensively from its native distribution range in Japan and Korea [@terada2002review]. This spread has occurred across temperate estuaries in North America, Europe, and other regions, facilitated by aquaculture and maritime activities [@rueness2005life; @weinberger2008invasive; @krueger2017genetic].

In regions like the Baltic Sea and the eastern United States, it can affect native fucoid macroalgae and seagrasses negatively [@van2003reintroduction; @thomsen2013effects; @firth2024invasive]. It can also alter sediment composition [@nyberg2009flora], and disrupts trophic interactions [@van2018global]. However *G. vermiculophylla* create new habitats for invertebrates and juvenile fish in a soft-bottom environment [@davoult2017multiple] and, more generally, can positively enhance ecosystem processes [@ramus2017invasive]. The negative and positive effects of this species [@thomsen2009distribution], which now dominate some coastal ecosystems, underscore the importance of monitoring and managing its population, particularly as climate change and anthropogenic pressures continue to facilitate biological invasions. 
*G. vermiculophylla* success as an invader stems from its tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, including temperature [@sotka2018combining], nutrient variability [@abreu2011nitrogen], and salinity [@weinberger2008invasive]. Its growth capacity at low salinities [@rueness2005life; @nyberg2007introduced] explains its presence in the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea [@weinberger2008invasive] but also in the mesohaline sheltered part of estuaries of the Atlantic coast of Europe **(Surget et al., 2017)**. It is also present in confined areas of lagoons characterized by low hydrodynamism [@abreu2011nitrogen; @sfriso2012spreading]. 
In Europe, it was first observed in 1996 in the Belon estuary (France) and later in many other estuaries on the coasts of Franch Brittany [@rueness2005life]. It can be found on hard substrates such as invertebrate's tubes and shells providing a substratum [@thomsen2007gracilaria] or attached to pebbles and rocks [@terada2002review] but the largest populations are colonizing soft-bottom sediment and particularly estuarine intertidal mudflats **(Surget et al., 2017)**. In this habitat, extensive dark red mats are observed at low tide, covering vast areas that have largely been unquantified in most studies. Therefore, *G. vermiculophylla* can establish populations in soft-bottom sediment habitats, previously devoid of macroalgae [@ramus2017invasive]. These mats are usually monospecific, with the alga thalli partially buried in the mud [@rueness2005life; @surget2017processus]. Intertidal mats can, however, be temporarily overgrown by ephemeral green macroalgae [@weinberger2008invasive]. In the European estuaries where *G. vermiculophylla* was first documented, large monospecific mats were reported to be confined to the upper intertidal zones [@rueness2005life]; however, their spatial distribution relative to the mudflat topography and elevation had not been quantitatively assessed. In coastal lagoons of the East Atlantic coast, @besterman2021predicting have shown that the mudflat topography was a significant predictor of its abundance. In fact, *G. vermiculophylla* has never been mapped using remote sensing techniques, and existing descriptions of its distribution lack spatially explicit mapping [@thomsen2007gracilaria; @weinberger2008invasive; @abreu2011nitrogen; @sfriso2012spreading]. 

Remote sensing has revolutionized our ability to monitor and manage coastal ecosystems, offering efficient and scalable methods for detecting environmental changes in intertidal vegetation across a wide range of spatio-temporal scales [@davies2024intertidal; @calleja2017long; @davies2024sentinel; @zoffoli2021decadal; @valle2015mapping]. Among remote-sensing technologies, drone-based imagery has recently emerged as a particularly promising tool for studying the spatial distribution of intertidal primary producers such as benthic microalgae [@roman2021using; @roman2024mapping], seagrass [@chand2021low; @duffy2018spatial; @roman2021using ; @oiry2024discriminating] and macroalgae [@rs14133124; @peidro2024quantifying]. While it lacks the temporal consistency of satellite missions, drone remote sensing makes it possible to acquire images at extremely high spatial resolution (i.e. cm-scale), rapidly target specific areas of interest, and provide observations in overcast conditions. In particular, the potential of drone remote sensing for monitoring the surface area occupied by IAS has been demonstrated [@roca2022monitoring]. Drone-based photogrammetry also makes it possible to characterize the distribution of intertidal vegetation together with mudflat geomorphology, thus improving our understanding of primary producers patterning [@brunier2022evolution; @douglas2024linking].

This study applied a drone-based remote sensing approach to map *G. vermiculophylla* spatial distribution at a very-high spatial resolution (centimeter) in intertidal estuaries of European Atlantic coast. We adapted a neural network classification model, Drone Intertidal Substrate Classification Of Vegetation (DISCOV, [@oiry2024discriminating]) by re-training the model with new pixels of *G. vermiculophylla*. An *in situ* data validation dataset was obtained from Franch and Spanish sites to estimate the classification accuracy. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data were concurrently acquired to map accuratly the intertidal elevation. A Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model (GLMM) was used to examine the relationship between *G. vermiculophylla* spatial distribution and informations on the mudflat topography. We expected the presence of *G. vermiculophylla* in mudflats to be associated with a specific height range as well as being more closely related to flat areas of the intertidal zone. In the Belon estuary (South Brittany, France) where it was first observed in Europe, a time-series of aerial images, from 1952 to 2024, was analyzed to describe the temporal changes of its distribution over the last seventy years.

## Materiel & Methods

### Study sites

Field campaigns were conducted at three study sites across France and Spain. At each site, two locations were investigated (@fig-location_sites_g). The Aven & Belon estuaries in South Brittany, France (@fig-location_sites_g A & C) are dynamic ria-type systems hosting diverse habitats, including tidal flats and subtidal zones with coarse, marine-origin sediments [@Michel2021; @Castaing1995]. These habitats support key benthic species such as *Scrobicularia plana*, *Cerastoderma edule*, and *Tellina tenuis*, which play essential roles in sediment bioturbation and nutrient cycling [@Tankoua2011; @Blanchet2014]. These estuaries serve as a nursery for juvenile fish and a feeding ground for migratory birds, with their ecological productivity driven by a mix of euryhaline and marine species adapted to salinity gradients [@Blanchet2014]. Oyster farming, particularly *Crassostrea gigas*, is a dominant activity, altering sediment dynamics and local biodiversity [@Michel2021]. Despite its ecological richness, the estuary faces pressures from nutrient loading and physical alteration [@Tankoua2011].

The Saja-Besaya Estuary, situated along the Cantabrian Coast in northern Spain, is characterized by the confluence of the Saja and Besaya rivers near Torrelavega (@fig-location_sites_g C). The estuary, also known as San Martín de la Arena or Suances Estuary, has been subject to significant anthropogenic pressures, including industrial developments throughout the 20th century. These activities have led to contamination from mining, paper manufacturing, and carbonate discharges, classifying the estuary as highly polluted near its upper reaches [@ortega2005fluxes]. This contamination impacted the water quality and biodiversity, with minimal aquatic life and sparse riverbank vegetation in its lower sections [@romero2008sintering].

#### Hyperspectral measurements

At each location, hyperspectral reflectance signatures were recorded using an ASD FieldSpec HandHeld 2 spectroradiometer (Malvern Panalytical, Worcestershire, UK), which measures reflectance from 325 to 1075 nm with a spectral resolution of approximately 1 nm (@fig-PictureFigure_G D). Each spectrum was subsequently smoothed using a Savitzky–Golay filter [@savitzky1964smoothing] with a third-order polynomial and an 11-point window, selected to minimize noise while preserving salient spectral features. After this initial smoothing, the first and second derivatives were computed using a central difference approximation (@eq-SecondDerivative).

$$
f''(\lambda_i) \approx \frac{f(\lambda_{i+1}) - 2f(\lambda_i) + f(\lambda_{i-1})}{(\Delta \lambda)^2}
$$ {#eq-SecondDerivative}

where $f(\lambda_i)$ is the reflectance at wavelength $\lambda_i$ and $\Delta \lambda$ is the uniform spectral sampling interval.

#### Drone data

A total of four drone flights were conducted across the three study sites. All flights were performed at an altitude of 120 m and a speed of 10 m·s⁻¹. Two flights were carried out in the Saja Estuary on June 25, 2024, covering areas of 20.4 hectares (Marisma de Cortiguera) and 8.4 hectares (Marisma de Cudón), respectively (@fig-location_sites_g). The other two flights took place in the Belon and Aven estuaries on April 11, 2024, covering areas of 21.3 hectares and 26.7 hectares, respectively.

##### Multispectral data {#sec-photo}

At each location, reflectance images with of 1.2 million pixels were captured using a DJI Matrice 300 quadcopter drone equipped with a Micasense RedEdge Dual MX multispectral camera. The camera recorded data across ten spectral bands, spanning from blue to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (444, 475, 531, 560, 650, 668, 705, 717, 740, and 840 nm). To ensure consistent lighting conditions, the drone's flight trajectory was aligned to maintain a solar azimuth angle of 90 degrees. Image acquisition was carried out with an overlap of 70% between side-by-side images and 80% between successive images along the flight path. A downwelling light sensor (DLS2) was used to measure real-time irradiance, enabling the correction of reflectance values for variations in light intensity caused by changing cloud cover during the flight. The raw image data were subsequently calibrated to reflectance using a calibration panel with \~50% reflectivity, provided by the camera's manufacturer. Images were processed using structure-from-motion photogrammetry software [@agisoft] to generate multispectral ortho-mosaics for each flight. The ortho-mosaicking workflow was consistent across all flights. Initially, key tie points were identified within each image and across overlapping images to create a sparse point cloud. This point cloud was refined by removing noisy points using a reprojection accuracy metric. Subsequently, a dense point cloud was generated using a structure-from-motion algorithm. A digital surface model (DSM) was then created through surface interpolation of the dense point cloud, which served as the basis for reconstructing the multispectral ortho-image [@nebel2020review]. The resolution of the multispectral ortho-mosaic obtained was 8 cm per pixel.

##### LiDAR data

Using the Matrice 300 Series Dual Gimbal Connector, a DJI Zenmuse L1 LiDAR and RGB sensor was mounted on the drone alongside the multispectral camera. This setup enabled the simultaneous capture of LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution RGB images, and multispectral images collected by the MicaSense RedEdge Dual MX during the same flight. The same processing workflow as @sec-photo was applied to process LiDAR RGB images, resulting in ortho-mosaic with a resolution of 2.5 cm per pixel. Since the mapping focused solely on surfaces without dense vegetation, the LiDAR measured only a single return. Operating in repetitive scanning mode with a sampling rate of 240 kHz, the system achieved a point density of 350 points per square meter. The LiDAR point cloud was extracted and converted into LAS format using DJI Terra software. The LAS point cloud was then imported into Agisoft Metashape [@agisoft] to generate a Digital Surface Model (DSM) with a resolution of 2.5 cm. From the DSM, the inclination angle of each pixel based on a grid of 8 surrounding pixels was computed using the terrain function of the 'terra' package in R [@terrapck]. The angle of the mudflat was categorized into three classes: Flat (angle \< 10°), Angled (10° ≤ angle ≤ 40°), and Steep (angle > 40°).

### Scene classification

In a previous study we developed a neural network classification model (DISCOV; @oiry2024discriminating), which was successfully applied to Micasense reflectance data for mapping intertidal vegetation along the Portuguese and French Atlantic coasts. In this study, the DISCOV v1.0 algorithm architecture and training dataset were utilized and enhanced (@fig-Workflow_g) to create DISCOV v2.0. Initially, DISCOV v1.0 model was trained with 5771 Rhodophyceae pixels, constituting only 3% of the training dataset [@oiry2024discriminating]. To address this limitation, the training dataset for DISCOV v2.0 was expanded with 427.000 (@sec-AnnexeA) new training pixels collected from the four drone flights over *G. vermiculophylla*-dominated sites (@sec-DroneFlights).

To validate the DISCOV V2.0 model, a user-friendly Shiny app was developed. This app enabled independent users to photo-interpret snapshots of the ortho-mosaic from each drone flight [@shinypck; @Simon2024ShinyApp]. Users could select on various parts of the snapshots to indicate the type of vegetation they believed was present. Using this method, three independent users helped create a validation dataset of 6755 pixels across 79 snapshots distributed among the four drone flights (@sec-AnnexeB). The validation dataset was then simplified into binary categories: the presence or absence of red macrolgae (@fig-Workflow_g).

### Historical Presence of *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* in the Bélon estuary

To assess the historical presence of *G. vermiculophylla* in the Belon Estuary, aerial imagery from flight campaigns was obtained via the French “Institut National de l’information Geographique et forestiere” (IGN) platform "Remonter Le Temps" [@RemonterLeTempsIGN]. Nine images were selected between 1952 and 2012 from the IGN platform and an additional one has been added for the year 2024 (@sec-AnnexeC). As most of the images obtained from "Remonter Le Temps" were digitized versions of physical photographs, inital georeferencing was conducted manually using QGIS software [@QGIS_software]. 

For each date, polygons have been drawn around *G. vermiculophylla* patches by visual photo-interpretation. These polygons were used to calculate the total area of the mudflat covered by macroalgae within a common extent of 30 hectares in Pont de Guilly, located in the Belon Estuary, South Brittany, France.

### Statistical analysis 

We used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) within a Bayesian framework using the 'brms' package in R [@brm1; @brm2; @brm3]. The response variable, the cover of *G. vermiculophylla*, was modeled using a Beta distribution as a function of bathymetry elevation and the angle of the mudflat (categorized as Flat, Angled, Steep). A random intercept for site was included to account for potential hierarchical variation among sampling sites. The Beta distribution was chosen because the response variable was continuous and constrained between 0 and 1. We visually assessed sample vs. fitted residuals and quartile–quartile (Q-Q) plots to ensure that the model assumptions, including appropriate model fit and absence of patterns in residuals, were satisfied.

## Results

### Historical records in the Belon estuary

A clear shift from bare sediment to vegetated mudflats has been observed over the past 70 years, corresponding to the colonization of the Belon Estuary by *G. vermiculophylla* ($Figure~\ref{fig-HistoricalMap_g}$). In the 50s, the tidal flats showed no detectable presence of vegetation. During the 70s some darkening of the sediment became discernible, but the first clear and unambiguous presence of *G. vermiculophylla* was recorded in 1982. During the subsequent decades, the cover of algae increased and in 2024, the high-resolution drone mapping showed that the mudflat was exclusively colonised  by monospecific mats of *G. vermiculophylla*. 

From the early recordings in the 1950s through the late 1970s, *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* coverage remained effectively at 0% ($Figure~\ref{fig-HistoricalMap_g}$). Shortly after the introduction of *Crassostrea gigas* in the estuary, in 1971-1972 (see vertical red dashed line in the figure), the first detectable presence of *G. vermiculophylla* emerged. By 1976, it covered 2.5% (0.7 ha) of the Pont du Guilly area, and by 1978 it had increased slightly to 3.0% (0.9 ha). From 1982 onward, coverage expanded more rapidly, increasing from 6.6% (2.0 ha) in 1982 to 14.7% (4.5 ha) in 1992 and nearly 30% (9.0 ha) by 1997. This upward trend continued into the 21st century, peaking at 41.2% (13.3 ha) in 2012. Although coverage fluctuated somewhat thereafter (40.6% in 2019 and 41.8% in 2024), it remained consistently high, indicating sustained and widespread colonization.

### Spectral description

The spectral signature of *G. vermiculophylla* was characterized by a reflectance pattern in the visible region of the spectrum shaped by the photosynthetic and accessory pigments common to all rhodophytes (@fig-SpecDescri A). This pattern was primarily driven by phycoerythrin and phycocyanin, which exhibited maximum absorption peaks at approximately 565 nm and 620 nm, respectively. An additional absorption feature around 495 nm was likely attributable to carotenoid pigments. The most pronounced absorption peak occurred at 675 nm, corresponding to chlorophyll-a absorption. The second derivative analysis clearly highlighted the inflection points corresponding to the main absorption peaks at 495, 565, 620, and 675 nm, allowing for more precise identification of the wavelength associated with these pigments (@fig-SpecDescri B).

### Spatial distribution

The classification map obtained from the neural network algorithm is shown for the Belon estuary (@fig-Belon A). Among the main classes of the intertidal vegetation, Rhodophyceae (red macroalgae) represented the dominant class cover, forming extensive, continous patches colonizing almost the entire mudflat. In contrast, Bacillariophyceae (diatoms biofilm) and Chlorophyceae (Green macroalgae) exhibited more localized distributions, typically restricted to smaller, fragmented patches. A few areas covered by Phaeophyceae (brown macroalgae) were confined to small patches in the upper intertidal attached to rocks. 
In the Saja esturay, Rhodophyceae cover was more sparse, due to a strong Chlorophyceae presence on this site (Annexe D: @sec-AnnexeD). 

Across all study sites the presence/absence of *G. vermiculophylla* was classified with a global accuracy of 91.1 %, a sensitivity of 96.5 % and a specificity of 71.5 %.

The elevation map showed that the main mats of G. vermiculophylla were located between 1 and 2 m above mean sea level (@fig-Belon C). The presence of red algea was strongly influenced by the elevation, with lower intertidal zones closer to the tidal channel consistently exhibiting reduced cover. 
Most of the intertidal flats exibited angle below 10° (Violet, (@fig-Belon D). Angled surfaces (10° < angle < 40°) often found adjacent to tidal channels, exhibited almost no vegetation cover.

```

Overall, the percent cover of *G. vermiculophylla* increased with elevation, as shown by the general relationship (@fig-Gam_Slope, black line), which rises from approximately 16% at the lowest elevation to about 30% at the highest elevation. This indicates a consistent positive association between elevation and algal cover.

When accounting for the slope angle, it was demonstrated that the angle influences the coverage, the percent cover of *G. vermiculophylla* increasing as angles became flatter. Specifically, for flat angles, the cover ranged from approximately 20% at the lowest elevation to nearly 38% at the highest elevation. In contrast, the increase was less pronounced for angled slopes, ranging from around 16% to 32%. The lowest cover was observed on steep angles, starting at about 15% and rising only slightly above 30% at the highest elevation (@fig-Gam_Slope).

## Discussion

### Drone mapping of *G. vermiculophylla* using machine learning approaches

In this study, we produced the first spatial distribution maps of the invasive red alga *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* using a multispectral drone survey conducted at low tide in Atlantic estuaries, representing varied environmental conditions. In French Brittany, the species formed monospecific mats, while in the spanish Cantabrian region, it was intermixed with other intertidal vegetation. Distinguishing among these vegetation types was a key prerequisite for the analysis.

To achieve this, we developed a new version of the deep learning-based classification model DISCOV [@oiry2024discriminating]. DISCOV v2.0 was based on an improved training dataset, which included a, larger number of pixels on red algae covering approximately 26 % of one million pixels and allowed the model to achieve an accuracy of 91.1 % on predicting *G. vermiculophylla* presence.

Rhodophytes possess unique phycobilin pigments, enabling their spectral distinction from other macroalgal groups [@douay2022new ; @olmedo2020far ; @rs11060704]. Even with the ten-band multispectral sensor used in our study, it remained feasible to discriminate the major classes of intertidal vegetation [@roman2021using; @oiry2024discriminating; @Davies2023]. Note that DISCOV V2.0 identifies *G. vermiculophylla* at the class level (Rhodophyceae) rather than at the species level. Although it is unlikely that Gracilaria can be precisely distinguished at species level using standard multispectral sensors [@douay2022new ; @olmedo2020far], hyperspectral data may allow mapping on a finer taxonomic resolution.

Ecological factors also aided in identifying *G. vermiculophylla*. Unlike many other macroalgae that require hard substrates, *G. vermiculophylla* establishes itself on soft-bottom sediments. In fact, it is commonly found on mudflats, anchoring its thalli in the top 10 cm of mud [@surget2017processus], and inhabitings the upper intertidal zone---an unusual trait for a Rhodophyte [@abreu2011nitrogen; @davoult2017multiple]. By effectively detecting *G. vermiculophylla* in these soft-substrate, upper intertidal habitats, our method provides a framework for identifying niche conditions that favor its spread. This information may provide managers with early-warning indicators to control its expansion before it reaches nuisance levels. Therefore, integrating spectral data with sediment characteristics serves as a strong indicator of *G. vermiculophylla* presence in European Atlantic estuaries, complementing the physical variables already used in species distribution modeling [@jmse11020367].

In addition, the scalability of drone-based surveying facilitates repeat mapping to detect temporal shifts in the distribution and abundance of *G. vermiculophylla.* Such continuous monitoring could capture seasonal patterns of colonization, allowing researchers and environmental managers to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures, track long-term ecological impacts, and anticipate future shifts in habitat suitability under changing climate conditions.

### *G. vermiculophylla* spatial distribution and mudflat topography

The spatial distribution of *G. vermiculophylla* across intertidal zones reveals a distinct relationship with mudflat topography, which significantly influences algal density and coverage. Our results show that higher elevations within the intertidal zone support greater densities of *G. vermiculophylla*. A pattern that aligns with findings by @thomsen2009distribution, where elevated areas provided optimal conditions for algal survival. *G. vermiculophylla* demonstrates remarkable physiological plasticity, enabling it to tolerate a broad spectrum of environmental conditions, including temperature fluctuations [@sotka2018combining], nutrient variability [@abreu2011nitrogen], and a wide range of salinities [@weinberger2008invasive]. Its capacity for sustained growth under low salinity conditions [@rueness2005life; @nyberg2007introduced] underpins its successful establishment and persistence within polyhaline and mesohaline estuarine environments. A strong constrain, however, for the algae is the hydrodynamism. Unlike seagrasses, another type of marine plant that can also colonize soft sediment, which possess rhizomes allowing for a robust anchorage, *G. vermiculophylla* lacks such specialized structures. Its attachment to the substrate relies solely on its buried thalli, which embed into the upper layers of soft sediment. This mode of anchorage renders the alga particularly vulnerable to high hydrodynamic conditions, as it lacks the structural stability needed to withstand strong currents or wave action. To partially bury its thalli into the sediment, *G. vermiculophylla* requires areas with high sedimentation rates. These conditions are typically found in the upper regions of estuarine systems or in proximity to other macrophytes, such as *Sporobolus* spp. (commonly known as small cordgrass), which reduce current velocity and promote sediment deposition [@mudd2010does]. This may explain the localization of one of the first areas colonized by *G. vermiculophylla* in the Belon esturay, observed in 1982-1992 near a patch of salt marsh ($Figure~\ref{fig-HistoricalMap_g}$). 
As a result, *G. vermiculophylla* compensates for its vulnerability to hydrodynamic forces by forming dense mats, which enhance its stability and facilitate its persistence and proliferation in intertidal and estuarine environments with low to moderate hydrodynamic conditions [@surget2017processus].

The negative relationship between angle steepness and the density of *G. vermiculophylla* can be explained by the physical and ecological characteristics of steeper mudflat areas. Steeper angles are typically associated with higher rates of water runoff during tidal exchanges, resulting in stronger hydrodynamic forces. These forces can lead to increased sediment erosion, reduced sedimentation, and less stable substrate conditions, which are unfavorable for *G. vermiculophylla* to anchor its thalli effectively [@besterman2021predicting]. Furthermore, steeper angles may limit the retention of organic matter and nutrients, reducing the availability of essential resources needed for algal growth.
In contrast, flatter areas within the intertidal zone are more likely to accumulate fine sediments and retain water for longer periods during low tides, creating a more stable and nutrient-rich environment conducive to *G. vermiculophylla* proliferation as well reduce desiccation effects. In turn, these conditions may favor the formation of dense algal mats, which further stabilize the sediment and promote growth.

### Monitoring *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* Invasion Dynamics

The invasive red alga *G. vermiculophylla* represents a significant example of delayed recognition and documentation in biological invasions. Historical aerial imagery and photo-interpretation analyses from the Bélon Estuary suggest the initial presence of this species in 1976 ($Figure~\ref{fig-HistoricalMap_g}$), preceding by two decades its first formal description in European waters in 1996 [@rueness2005life]. This delay likely stems from insufficient early monitoring frameworks and limited awareness of its ecological impacts, which often characterize the early stages of invasive species colonization. It also arises from the fact that others red macroalgae species, resembling *G. vermiculophylla* and native to this area (e.g. *Gracilaria gracilis*) were already present at sites where *G. vermiculophylla* was introduced, further complicating its detection. This lag highlights challenges associated with the detection, monitoring, and reporting of invasive species and their ecological impacts during early colonization.

The appearance of *G. vermiculophylla* in 1976 coincides with the introduction of the Pacific oyster (*Crassostrea gigas*) into the estuary, a few years before, between 1971 and 1975, which was pointed as a potential the introduced the algae in Europe [@grizel1991introduction ; @rueness2005life]. Aquaculture practices, such as the transfer of oyster spat and equipment between regions, facilitate the unintentional transport of invasive algal fragments. For instance, *G. vermiculophylla* may have attached to shells or nets used in oyster farming, enabling its spread to new estuarine habitats. After initial establishment, in the 70's and early 80's ($Figure~\ref{fig-HistoricalMap_g}$), the alga progressively occupied suitable habitats, consistent with theoretical invasion dynamics involving a lag phase followed by rapid spread in the 90's [@arim2006spread]. The establishment of *G. vermiculophylla* likely induced changes in sediment characteristics, trophic interactions, and habitat structure prior to formal recognition [@bendor2006spatial]. Such shifts are comparable to documented impacts in similar systems [@crowl2008spread ; @gallardo2016global], yet remain difficult to quantify without early monitoring data. Remote sensing using multispectral drone mapping can provide high-resolution, spatially explicit data, but it must be combined with repeated, *in situ* field measurements to maximize its potential [@chadwick2020integrating ; @zoffoli2023remote ; @zoffoli2021decadal]. Temporal repetition makes it possible to assess dynamic processes, and integrating these mapping approaches with *in situ* analyses of local infauna, carbon cycling, riverine inputs, and sedimentology yields valuable data for local managers. Such an integrated approach can determine how the invasive algae affects the local ecosystem and, more broadly, forecast its potential impact on other estuarine environments facing similar invasion events.

The temporal gap between the first presence and documentation reflects limitations in early surveillance, potentially underestimating ecological and economic impacts during the initial colonization phase. Studies on invasion dynamics demonstrate that early detection is crucial for effective containment and management, particularly before an invasion reaches the exponential spread phase, which complicates control efforts [@bendor2006spatial ; @arim2006spread ; @elton2020ecology]. Specific practices, such as the removal of early-stage algal mats, implementation of physical barriers to prevent further spread, and public awareness campaigns, could mitigate the impacts during this critical phase [@jones2021use ; @green2021functional ; @simberloff2021maintenance]. In the Bélon Estuary, *G. vermiculophylla* appears to have thrived under ecological conditions favorable to its proliferation, enabling the formation of dense mats in about 6 years (between 1976 and 1982; $Figure~\ref{fig-HistoricalMap_g}$) after its first detection in the estuary. This undocumented growth likely contributed to substantial changes in the estuarine ecosystem. Historical aerial imagery has provided valuable insights into long-term invasion patterns by enabling the retrospective identification of shifts in habitat characteristics. Modern drone-based systems enhance this capacity through high spatial and temporal resolution, enabling the rapid detection of invasive species at early stages of establishment. By capturing detailed data on the spatial distribution and habitat preferences of species such as *G. vermiculophylla*, remote sensing facilitates timely interventions, allowing stakeholders to take rapid measures to limit the invasion. Integrating these tools into routine monitoring programs offers a scalable and efficient means to track invasive species dynamics and inform targeted management strategies, such as habitat restoration, removal of invasive mats, and prevention of further spread through targeted interventions. Expanding these methodologies to lower-cost RGB-based detection would further democratize access to monitoring tools, enabling more widespread application for early detection and rapid response. These tools could also be integrated into community-driven management programs, empowering local stakeholders to monitor invasive species and implement timely control measures.

## Conclusion

In this study, we demonstrated the potential of high-resolution drone-based multispectral remote sensing to map the spatial and temporal distribution of the invasive red macroalga *G. vermiculophylla* in European estuaries. By releasing the DISCOV v2.0 model, updated to include an extensive dataset of Rhodophyceae pixels, we achieved a classification accuracy of 91.1%. Our analysis revealed a clear spatial relationship between *G. vermiculophylla* and intertidal topography retrieved from LiDAR, with its cover consistently higher in flat, elevated mudflats compared to lower and steeper areas. The remarkable physiological plasticity of *G. vermiculophylla* enabling ot to thrive in diverse environmental conditions, further underscores its adaptability and invasive potential. However, its reliance on sediment stability and vulnerability to hydrodynamic forces delineate its prefered habitat with the intertidal zones. 

The temporal progression, derived from a historical dataset spanning over seven decades, highlights the progressive establishment and expansion of the algae. Notably, our aerial imagery analysis confirmed the presence of *G. vermiculophylla* in the Belon Estuary approximately 20 years before its first scientific description, emphasizing the value of retrospective mapping.

This historical analysis provided crucial insights into the dynamics of *G. vermiculophylla*'s invasion, revealing a lag phase followed by rapid colonization. This expansion coincided with the development of oyster aquaculture, suggesting a potential link between human activities and the proliferation of this invasive species.
These findings underscore the crucial role of remote sensing in ecological research, particularly in studying invasive species. By leveraging high-resolution, scalable technologies, we can not only map current distributions but also uncover historical patterns that would otherwise remain unknown. The identification of *G. vermiculophylla* decades prior to its formal description exemplifies this capability. This discovery provides a compelling basis for re-evaluating historical data to understand the broader implications of invasive species dynamics. Moving forward, integrating hyperspectral sensors could enhance species-level discrimination, while adopting low-cost RGB-based methods could extend monitoring capacities to a broader range of stakeholders. Incorporating these advancements into environmental management frameworks can enable proactive monitoring, timely interventions, and habitat restoration efforts. These advancements will be crucial for informing management strategies, fostering community engagement, and preserving estuarine biodiversity in the face of ongoing ecological changes.
