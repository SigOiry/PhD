abstract = {Despite the green macroalga Ulva spp. be indicated for diverse commercial purposes and cultivated in integrated aquaculture to remediate animal effluents, most of their biomass is not commercially used. As a new application, it could be used as raw material for carotenoids production. To evaluate this, a literature research was conducted on Ulva spp. carotenoids content, their physiological responses to environmental factors and the experimental processing and analysis used. Ulva spp. carotenoids were identified by analysis of absorption spectra and retention times after chromatography separation; these were lutein, $\beta$-carotene, neoxanthin, $\beta$-cryptoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. Total carotenoids yield depends on the strain and is positively related to biomass growth. The optimization of the cultivation conditions such as light intensity, nutrients concentration, temperature and salinity can improve carotenoids production. In addition, strategies such as selenium or plant hormones addition, exclusion of incident ultraviolet (UV) light (for few days), and brief induction of physiological stress by extreme hyposalinity, temperature variation and CO2 depletion can further increase this yield. The increase of carotenoids after physiological stress induction would constitute a direct response to maintain the photosynthesis rate and/or eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), or indirect, caused by the increase of antioxidant enzymes and other antioxidant metabolites, which would protect them. In this sense, nutrient enrichment is required to cope with oxidative stress. High PAR intensity decrease photosynthetic pigments yield in minutes (and recover after dark period) while photoprotective carotenoids yield remains constant. The activation of the xanthophyll cycle (violaxanthin to zeaxanthin conversion) is dependent on temperature, and can be induced by high light intensity, hypersalinity or desiccation (under dim light). The xanthophyll cycle is the main non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanism in Ulva spp. during the first period of acclimation to high light intensity.},

ABSTRACT = {Shading and inter-reflections created by the three-dimensional coral canopy structure play an important role on benthic reflectance and its propagation above the water. Here, a plane parallel model was coupled with a three-dimensional radiative transfer canopy model, incorporating measured coral shapes and hyperspectral benthic reflectances, to investigate this question under different illumination and water column conditions. Results indicated that a Lambertian treatment of the bottom reflectance can be a reasonable assumption if a variable shading factor is included. Without flexibility in the shading treatment, nadir view bottom reflectances can vary by as much as &plusmn;20% (or &plusmn;9% in above-water remote sensing reflectance) under solar zenith angles (SZAs) up to 50&deg;. Spectrally-independent shading factors are developed for benthic coral reflectance measurements based on the rugosity of the coral. In remote sensing applications, where the rugosity is unknown, a shading factor could be incorporated as an endmember for retrieval in the inversion scheme. In dense coral canopies in clear shallow waters, the benthos cannot always be treated as Lambertian, and for large solar-view angles the bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BRDF) hotspot propagated to above water reflectances can create up to a 50% or more difference in water-leaving reflectances, and discrepancies of 20% even for nadir-view geometries.},

@article{Bracher2015,
abstract = {The composition and abundance of algal pigments provide information on phytoplankton community characteristics such as photoacclimation, overall biomass and taxonomic composition. In particular, pigments play a major role in photoprotection and in the light-driven part of photosynthesis. Most phytoplankton pigments can be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques applied to filtered water samples. This method, as well as other laboratory analyses, is time consuming and therefore limits the number of samples that can be processed in a given time. In order to receive information on phytoplankton pigment composition with a higher temporal and spatial resolution, we have developed a method to assess pigment concentrations from continuous optical measurements. The method applies an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to remote-sensing reflectance data derived from ship-based hyperspectral underwater radiometry and from multispectral satellite data (using the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer - MERIS - Polymer product developed by Steinmetz et al., 2011) measured in the Atlantic Ocean. Subsequently we developed multiple linear regression models with measured (collocated) pigment concentrations as the response variable and EOF loadings as predictor variables. The model results show that surface concentrations of a suite of pigments and pigment groups can be well predicted from the ship-based reflectance measurements, even when only a multispectral resolution is chosen (i.e., eight bands, similar to those used by MERIS). Based on the MERIS reflectance data, concentrations of total and monovinyl chlorophyll a and the groups of photoprotective and photosynthetic carotenoids can be predicted with high quality. As a demonstration of the utility of the approach, the fitted model based on satellite reflectance data as input was applied to 1 month of MERIS Polymer data to predict the concentration of those pigment groups for the whole eastern tropical Atlantic area. Bootstrapping explorations of cross-validation error indicate that the method can produce reliable predictions with relatively small data sets (e.g., < 50 collocated values of reflectance and pigment concentration). The method allows for the derivation of time series from continuous reflectance data of various pigment groups at various regions, which can be used to study variability and change of phytoplankton composition and photophysiology.},

abstract = {The study investigated seasonal changes in the photo-regulatory mechanisms of microphytobenthos found in intertidal mudflats (Aiguillon Bay, the Atlantic, France) and non-tidal sandy coastal shallows (Puck Bay, the Baltic, Poland) based on photosynthetic pigment characteristics and the estimates of photosynthetic parameters obtained through oxygen evolution measurements. The intertidal communities consisted of motile diatom species typical of epipelon. The non-tidal microphytobenthos was composed of epipsammic species mostly belonging to four taxonomic groups chiefly contributing to the assemblage biomass, namely cyanobacteria, euglenophytes, green algae and diatoms (comprising mainly small-sized species). The epipelon was low light acclimated as shown by the lower values of photoprotective/photosynthetic (PPC/PSC) carotenoids and diatoxanthin/diadinoxanthin (Dt/Dd) ratios. In contrast, the epipsammon exhibited features of high light acclimation (high PPC/PSC and Dt/Dd ratios). In both microphytobenthos types, the photosynthetic capacity (Pm) showed the same seasonal variation pattern and there were no statistically significant differences between the investigated sites in corresponding seasons (P>0.05). In both assemblage types, the photosynthetic efficiency at limiting irradiance ($\alpha$) decreased over time. The epipelon had higher $\alpha$ compared to the epipsammon. Seasonal changes of the photoacclimation index (Ek) estimated for the epipelic communities reflected variations observed in Pm, whereas in the epipsammon an increasing trend in Ek values was observed. Ek was always higher for the epipsammon when comparing analogous seasons, which further corroborated low and high light acclimation in the epipelic and epipsammic communities, respectively. The presence of the photoinhibition parameter ($\beta$) in the epipelon and the lack of it in the epipsammon suggested that the latter was resistant to high irradiance and the physiological mechanisms were sufficient to protect it from photoinhibition. In the epipelon, a downturn in photosynthetic rates showed that it was susceptible to high light intensities, suggesting that physiological photoprotective mechanisms must be supported by behavioural photoacclimation in order to avoid damaging light influence.},

abstract = {Changes in the photobiology and photosynthetic pigments of the seagrass Zostera marina from Chesapeake Bay (USA) were examined under a range of natural and manipulated irradiance regimes. Photosynthetic activity was assessed using chlorophyll-a fluorescence, and photosynthetic pigments were measured by HPLC. Large changes in the violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and antheraxanthin content were concomitant with the modulation of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Photokinetics (Fv/Fm, rapid light curves (RLC), and non-photochemical quenching) varied as a result of oscillating irradiance and were highly correlated to xanthophyll pigment content. Zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin concentrations increased under elevated light conditions, while violaxanthin increased in darkened conditions. Unusually high concentrations of antheraxanthin were found in Z. marina under a wide range of light conditions, and this was associated with the partial conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin. These results support the idea that xanthophyll intermediate pigments induce a photoprotective response during exposure to high irradiances in this seagrass. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Therefore, it is important to quantitatively assess the possibility of mapping seagrass species using multispectral images by resampling seagrass species spectra to multispectral bands. Seagrass species spectra were measured on harvested seagrass leaves. Spectral resolution of multispectral images used in this research was adopted from WorldView-2, Quickbird, Sentinel-2A, ASTER VNIR, and Landsat 8 OLI. These images are widely available and can be a good representative and baseline for previous or future remote sensing images. Seagrass species considered in this research are Enhalus acoroides (Ea), Thalassodendron ciliatum (Tc), Thalassia hemprichii (Th), Cymodocea rotundata (Cr), Cymodocea serrulata (Cs), Halodule uninervis (Hu), Halodule pinifolia (Hp), Syringodum isoetifolium (Si), Halophila ovalis (Ho), and Halophila minor (Hm). Multispectral resampling analysis indicate that the resampled spectra exhibit similar shape and pattern with the original spectra but less precise, and they lose the unique absorption feature of seagrass species. Relying on spectral bands alone, multispectral image is not effective in mapping these seagrass species individually, which is shown by the poor and inconsistent result of Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification technique in classifying seagrass species using seagrass species spectra as pure endmember. Only Sentinel-2A produced acceptable classification result using SAM.},

In vivo and extract absorbance characteristics indicated that concentrations of UV absorbing compounds were highest among rhodophytes. Additionally, a marked consistency was observed in the visible spectral region, 400 to 750 nm, for in vivo absorbance and fourth derivative maxima for species within specific taxonomic divisions. For Gracilaria salicornia, pigment and photosynthetic performance acclimation paralleled the sun to shade irradiance gradient established by its mat-like morphology.

It is therefore important to understand how the spectra of different seagrass species vary, in order to establish their unique absorption features and how these can be utilised for mapping by making use of remote-sensing images. This paper presents measurements of the reflectance spectra between 400 and 900 nm for nine tropical species of seagrass. Continuum removal and multispectral resampling procedures were applied to the spectra. Dendrogram analysis was carried out to identify species clustering as the basis for a mapping scheme. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) approaches were employed for the classification of seagrass species using WorldView-2 images and measured spectra as the input endmember. Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) and an image segmentation approach using CTA (Object-Based Image Analysis–OBIA) were performed as a means of comparison. The results indicate that the absorption features and overall shape of the spectra for all seagrass species are relatively similar, and implied that the major differences are attributable to the absolute reflectance values. Consequently, SAM and SID produced results of low accuracy (<30%), whereas, CTA and OBIA delivered results exhibiting higher accuracy (60–92%). The use of a spectral-based classification algorithm was ineffective for the classification and mapping of seagrass species using multispectral images. The utilisation of absolute reflectance values was beneficial for the classification of seagrass species having similar spectral shape.},

Thalassia spectra are also compared to previously studied forest species, showing that the spectral reflectance signature of Thalassia was of the same general shape as forest species, but of lesser peak height (18% vs 28-50%) in the 750-759 nm range. For marine plants, near-infrared reflectance of Thalassia, Syringodium and Halodule was intermediate (18%) between the ubiquitous green alga Ulva (15%) and the temperate brown alga, Fucus (27%). The brown alga had a unique spectral signature in the first difference spectrum (three secondary peaks at differing spectral values than the other species' secondary peaks). Comparisons between Halodule, Syringodium and Thalassia near-infrared peaks and Halimeda (58%), Penicillus (29%) and Udotea (42%), subtropical/ tropical algae, were also carried out. Halimeda differed most from the other green algae in terms of numerous oscillations from 450 to 700 nm seen in the first difference spectrum. The three seagrasses were similar in spectral reflectance curve shape to one another but differed somewhat in peak height. The first difference spectrum was helpful in pointing out subtle differences among the species and between algae and seagrass. Spectral reflectance data such as those presented here appear potentially useful for remote sensing of shallow habitats, and may additionally be used to monitor their health.},

abstract = {This study assessed recently launched multispectral sensors to map seagrass properties for a $\sim$ 150 km2 shallow bank in Moreton Bay, Australia. We utilised a previously developed semi-automated, objectbased image analysis classification routine for our comparison, utilising field and image data as input. Field data were collected through georeferenced photograph transects which were analysed for species composition and percentage cover. Field data collection occurred close to image capture from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (30 m pixel), Sentinel-2 (10 m pixel), Ziyuan-3A (5 m pixel), and WorldView-3 (2 m pixel) sensors. The output maps had average overall accuracies of 66% for species and 57% for percentage cover maps. The study concluded that all sensors tested were suitable for mapping seagrass meadows in clear shallow waters, but the higher resolution sensors provided more detail and were considered more representative. The choice of sensor would depend upon the extent of the seagrass meadow, available funds and frequency of observation.},

abstract = {Coastal areas are key to sustaining biodiversity, but their complexity and variability makes their analysis challenging. On the other hand, mountain ecosystems include a large percentage of the global biodiversity and their monitoring is essential, as they are especially vulnerable to climate change. In this context, remote sensing offers a cost-effective technology for the conservation of both kinds of natural areas. In this work, multispectral and hyperspectral data recorded by sensors, onboard satellites, aircrafts and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), have been used for the sustainable management of natural resources. Specifically, a multiplatform methodology has been developed to process multisensor high spatial resolution imagery and the main benefits and drawbacks of each technology have been identified. Advanced processing techniques in each stage of the methodology have been selected to provide accurate and validated benthic and vegetation maps. Two challenging ecosystems, located in Cabrera and Teide National Parks, have been selected for this study. They correspond with a coastal and a mountain island ecosystem, respectively. To address the associated challenges, the use of imagery with the maximum spatial and spectral resolution, provided by Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, CASI and Pika-L, has been considered. Results have been validated with in-situ data and by the National Parks' managers and they have shown the ability of remote sensing to accurately map both Parks when the appropriate imagery and techniques are selected. The best performance was achieved with the Support Vector Machine classifier and, in general, WorldView can be considered the most appropriate platform when factoring in cost, coverage and accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the reflectance difference values between the respective spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) of Sentinel 2A/2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8/9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors for seagrass, algae, and mixed species discrimination and monitoring in a shallow marine environment southeast of Bahrain Island in the Arabian Gulf. To achieve these, a field survey was conducted to collect samples of seawater, underwater sediments, seagrass (Halodule uninervis and Halophila stipulacea), and algae (green and brown). In addition, an experimental mode was established in a goniometric laboratory to simulate the marine environment, and spectral measurements were performed using an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer. Measured spectra and their transformation using the continuum-removed reflectance spectral (CRRS) approach were analyzed to assess spectral separability among separate or mixed species at varying coverage rates. Afterward, the spectra were resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands of MSI and OLI sensors and converted into water vegetation indices (WVIs) to investigate the potential of red, green, and blue bands for seagrass and algae species discrimination. The results of spectral and CRRS analyses highlighted the importance of the blue, green, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths for seagrass and algae detection and likely discrimination based on hyperspectral measurements. However, when resampled and convolved in MSI and OLI bands, spectral information loses the specific and unique absorption features and becomes more generalized and less precise. Therefore, relying on the multispectral bandwidth of MSI and OLI sensors, it is difficult or even impossible to differentiate or to map seagrass and algae individually at the species level. Instead of the red band, the integration of the blue or the green band in WVI increases their power to discriminate submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), particularly the water adjusted vegetation index (WAVI), water enhanced vegetation index (WEVI), and water transformed difference vegetation index (WTDVI). These results corroborate the spectral and the CRRS analyses. However, despite the power of blue wavelength to penetrate deeper into the water, it also leads to a relative overestimation of dense SAV coverage due to more scattering in this part of the spectrum. Furthermore, statistical fits (p<0.05) between the reflectance in the respective VNIR bands of MSI and OLI revealed excellent linear relationships (R2 of 0.999) with insignificant root mean square difference (RMSD) (≤g0.0015). Important agreement (0.63g≤gR2g≤g0.96) was also obtained between respective WVI regardless of the integrated spectral bands (i.e., red, green, and blue), yielding insignificant RMSD (≤g0.01). Accordingly, these results pointed out that MSI and OLI sensors are spectrally similar, and their data can be used jointly to monitor accurately the spatial distribution of SAV and its dynamic in time and space in shallow marine environments, provided that rigorous data pre-processing issues are addressed.},

abstract = {Eelgrass is a sentinel species that can indicate the overall health of a coastal ecosystem. An effective coastal management strategy should therefore map and actively monitor the distribution of this sentinel for any significant changes. While manual transect methods are commonly employed to map eelgrass, the analysis of remote imagery has been proposed as an efficient alternative; a remote sensor can capture large and inaccessible areas cost- and time-effectively, nearly instantly, and with high frequency. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare the efficacy of high spatial resolution airborne (AISA) and satellite (IKONOS) imagery for mapping eelgrass distribution at Sidney Spit, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada (GINPRC). The primary objective was to determine the optimal spectral resolution, spatial resolution and image processing effort for resolving bed location. A two-meter resolution hyperspectral AISA image and a four-meter resolution multispectral IKONOS image were acquired over Sidney Spit in August 2008. Concurrently collected were in situ above-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, underwater videography, and water samples for optical constituent analysis. The images were subjected to varying combinations of 1) image processing steps: atmospheric correction, surface glint correction, deep water masking, and water column removal; 2) image classifiers: with differing user effort and data input requirements; and 3) spectral resolution: > 200-band AISA versus a reduced resolution AISA image (AISA(r)) of only four key bands unique to eelgrass - slope 500-530. nm, first derivatives of 556. nm, 580. nm, and 602. nm (O'Neill et al. (2011)) - versus four-band IKONOS. The highest classification accuracies were achieved with atmospheric correction, glint correction, deep water masking, and maximum likelihood (ML) classification of the AISA(r) image and IKONOS full resolution image. AISA(r) achieved eelgrass producer and user accuracies of 85% in water less than 3. m deep, and 93% in deeper areas. IKONOS achieved 79% for water less than 3. m deep and 91% in deeper areas. Most confusion occurred between eelgrass and green algae, and between exposed eelgrass and other exposed vegetation. The most automated combination of methods yielded poor accuracies but could be greatly improved by refining atmospheric correction input parameters and building on the endmember spectral library. This study resulted in recommendations for remote eelgrass mapping and monitoring within the GINPRC. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Seagrass is an important structural and functional component of the global marine ecosystem and is of high value for its ecological services. This paper took Xincun Bay (including Xincun Harbor and Li'an Harbor) of Hainan Province as the study area, combined ground truth data, and adopted two methods to map seagrass in 2020 using Chinese GF2 satellite images: maximum-likelihood and object-oriented classification. Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2020 were used to extract information on seagrass distribution changes. The following conclusions were obtained. (1) Based on GF2 imagery, both the classical maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method and the object-based image analysis (OBIA) method can effectively extract seagrass information, and OBIA can also portray the overall condition of seagrass patches. (2) The total seagrass area in the study area in 2020 was about 395 hectares, most of which was distributed in Xincun Harbor. The southern coast of Xincun Harbor is an important area where seagrass is concentrated over about 228 hectares in a strip-like continuous distribution along the coastline. (3) The distribution of seagrasses in the study area showed a significant decaying trend from 2016 to 2020. The total area of seagrass decreased by 79.224 ha during the five years from 2016 to 2020, with a decay rate of 16.458%. This study is the first on the comprehensive monitoring of seagrass in Xincun Bay using satellite remote sensing images, and comprises the first use of GF2 data in seagrass research, aiming to provide a reference for remote sensing monitoring of seagrass in the South China Sea.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new semisupervised segmentation algorithm, suited to high-dimensional data, of which remotely sensed hyperspectral image data sets are an example. The algorithm implements two main steps: 1) semisupervised learning of the posterior class distributions followed by 2) segmentation, which infers an image of class labels from a posterior distribution built on the learned class distributions and on a Markov random field. The posterior class distributions are modeled using multinomial logistic regression, where the regressors are learned using both labeled and, through a graph-based technique, unlabeled samples. Such unlabeled samples are actively selected based on the entropy of the corresponding class label. The prior on the image of labels is a multilevel logistic model, which enforces segmentation results in which neighboring labels belong to the same class. The maximum a posteriori segmentation is computed by the $\alpha$-expansion min-cut-based integer optimization algorithm. Our experimental results, conducted using synthetic and real hyperspectral image data sets collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer system of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the regions of Indian Pines, IN, and Salinas Valley, CA, reveal that the proposed approach can provide classification accuracies that are similar or higher than those achieved by other supervised methods for the considered scenes. Our results also indicate that the use of a spatial prior can greatly improve the final results with respect to a case in which only the learned class densities are considered, confirming the importance of jointly considering spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral image segmentation. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {It is clear that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general far slower than required and it has been a major bottleneck in their applications for past decades. Two key reasons behind may be: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these conventional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on a few artificial and real benchmark function approximation and classification problems including very large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.11For the preliminary idea of the ELM algorithm, refer to "Extreme Learning Machine: A New Learning Scheme of Feedforward Neural Networks", Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN2004), Budapest, Hungary, 25-29 July, 2004. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images by support vector machines (SVMs). First, we propose a theoretical discussion and experimental analysis aimed at understanding and assessing the potentialities of SVM classifiers in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities. To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier). Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular, four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture. The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.},

abstract = {Land use / land cover classification of remote sensing images provide information to take efficient decisions related to resource monitoring. There exists several algorithms for remote sensing image classification. In the recent years, Deep learning models like Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for remote sensing image classification. The learning and generalization ability of CNN, results in better performance in comparison with similar type of models. The functional behaviour of CNNs is unexplainable because of its multiple layers of convolution and pooling operations. This results in black box characteristics of CNNs. Motivated with this factor, a CNN model with functional transparency is proposed in the present study. The model is named as Knowledge Based Morphological Deep Transparent Neural Networks (KBMDTNN) for remote sensing image classification. The architecture of KBMDTNN model provides functional transparency due to application of morphological operators, convolutional and pooling layers, and transparent neural network. In KBMDTNN model, the morphological operator preserve the information related to the edges, lines and boundaries through efficient image segmentation. Convolution and pooling layers are used to produce minimal number of features from the image. The operational transparency of proposed model is coined based on the mathematical understanding of each layer in the model instead of randomly adding layers to the architecture of model. The transparency of proposed model is also because of assigning the initial weights of NN in output layer of model with computed values instead of random values.},

abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management.},

abstract = {Seagrasses provide a number of critical ecosystem services, including habitat for numerous species, sediment stabilization, and shoreline protection. Ariel photography is a useful tool to estimate the areal extent of seagrasses, but recent innovations in radiometrically calibrated sensors and algorithm development have allowed identification of benthic types and retrieval of absolute density. This study demonstrates the quantitative ability of a high spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral sensor (3.2 nm bandwidth) in the complex coastal waters of Saint Joseph's Bay (SJB). Several benthic types were distinguished, including submerged and floating aquatic vegetation, benthic red algae, bare sand, and optically deep water. A total of 23.6 km2 of benthic vegetation was detected, indicating no dramatic change in vegetation area over the past 30 years. SJB supported high seagrass density at depths shallower than 2 m with an average leaf area index of 2.0 ± 0.6 m2 m−2. Annual seagrass production in the bay was 13,570 t C year−1 and represented 41 % of total marine primary production. The effects of coarser spatial resolution were investigated and found to reduce biomass retrievals, underestimate productivity, and alter patch size statistics. Although data requirements for this approach are considerable, water column optical modeling may reduce the in situ requirements and facilitate the transition of this technique to routine monitoring efforts. The ability to quantify not just areal extent but also productivity of a seagrass meadow in optically complex coastal waters can provide information on the capacity of these environments to support marine food webs.},

It is generally agreed that many model processes are not accurately depicted by current remotely sensed indices of vegetation and that new observational capabilities are needed at different spatial and spectral scales to reduce uncertainty. Recent advances in materials and optics have allowed the development of smaller, more stable, accurately calibrated imaging spectrometers that can quantify biophysical properties on the basis of the spectral absorbing and scattering characteristics of the land surface. Airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, which measure large numbers (hundreds) of narrow spectral bands, are becoming more widely available from government and commercial sources; thus, it is increasingly feasible to use data from imaging spectroscopy for environmental research.

abstract = {Remote sensing has become an increasingly used technique for the thematic mapping of large marine areas. In recent years, many researchers have successfully applied these techniques in different places for benthic mapping in clear waters; however, areas with turbid waters present important limitations that are gradually being solved by recent technological advances. In this context, the main objective of the present study is to develop and validate a methodology for mapping intertidal and subtidal kelp forests in the Galician coast (NW Spain), based on images from SPOT-4 (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre). Three analysis methods have been applied: visual analysis and interpretation, unsupervised classification (cluster) and supervised classification (angular classification and maximum likelihood classification). Classification percentages higher than 70% in all substrates were obtained both using visual analysis and interpretation and maximum likelihood classification. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {One of the objectives of monitoring benthic algal cover is to observe short- and long-term changes in species distribution and structure of coastal benthic habitats as indicators of ecological state. Mapping benthic algal cover with conventional methods (diving) provides great accuracy and high resolution, yet is very expensive and is limited by the time and manpower necessary. We measured reflectance spectra of three indicator species for the Baltic Sea: Cladophora glomerata (green macroalgae), Furcellaria lumbricalis (red macroalgae), and Fucus vesiculosus (brown macroalgae) and used a bio-optical model in an attempt to estimate whether these algae are separable from each other and sandy bottom or deep water by means of satellite remote sensing. Our modelling results indicate that to some extent it is possible to map the studied species with multispectral satellite sensors in turbid waters. However, the depths where the macroalgae can be detected are often shallower than the maximum depths where the studied species usually grow. In waters deeper than just a few meters, the differences between the studied bottom types are seen only in band 2 (green) of the multispectral sensors under investigation. It means that multispectral sensors are capable of detecting difference in brightness only in one band which is insufficient for recognition of different bottom types in waters where no or few in situ data are available. Configuration of MERIS spectral bands allows the recognition of red, green and brown macroalgae based on their spectral signatures provided the algal belts are wider than MERIS spatial resolution. Commercial stock of F. lumbricalis in West-Estonian Archipelago covers area where MERIS 300 m spatial resolution is adequate. However, strong attenuation of light in the water column and signal to noise ratio of the sensor do not allow mapping of Furcellaria down to maximum depths where it occurs. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigate the abilities of seven remote sensors to classify coral, algae, and carbonate sand based on 10,632 reflectance spectra measured in situ on reefs around the world. Discriminant and classification analyses demonstrate that full-resolution (1 nm) spectra provide very good spectral separation of the bottom-types. We assess the spectral capabilities of the sensors by applying to the in situ spectra the spectral responses of two airborne hyperspectral sensors (AAHIS and AVIRIS), three satellite broadband multispectral sensors (Ikonos, Landsat-ETM+ and SPOT-HRV), and two hypothetical satellite narrowband multispectral sensors (Proto and CRESPO). Classification analyses of the simulated sensor-specific spectra produce overall classification accuracy rates of 98%, 98%, 93%, 91%, 64%, 58%, and 50% for AAHIS, AVIRIS, Proto, CRESPO, Ikonos, Landsat-ETM+, and SPOT-HRV, respectively. Analyses of linearly mixed sensor-specific spectra reveal that the hyperspectral and narrowband multispectral sensors have the ability to discriminate between coral and algae across many levels of mixing, while the broadband multispectral sensors do not. Applying the results of the general mixing analyses to a specific spatial organization of coral, algae, and sand indicates that the hyperspectral sensors accurately estimate areal cover of the bottom-types regardless of pixel resolution. The narrowband multispectral sensors overestimate coral cover by 11-15%, while the broadband sensors underestimate algae cover by 7-29% and overestimate coral cover by 24-103%. We conclude that currently available satellite sensors are inadequate for assessment of global coral reef status, but that it is both necessary and possible to design a sensor system suited to the task. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Microphytobenthic (MPB) biofilms are taxonomically mixed microbial assemblages (e.g. cyanobacteria, chlorophyta and diatoms) responsible for important estuarine ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient fluxes, sediment cohesion, and primary productivity). MPB biofilms exhibit high spatial-temporal variation leading to high variability in collected data and requiring high sampling replication. Thus there is an increasing interest in developing remote sensing tools to quantify and describe MPB biofilms. The objectives of the current work were to investigate the effect of MPB taxonomic diversity on biofilm spectral reflectance signatures and to investigate the possibility of using second derivative analysis to estimate MPB chlorophyll a (as a proxy for biomass) and pigment composition in monospecific and mixed species biofilms. Two diatoms, Amphora coffeaeformis (Agardh) K{\"{u}}tzing and Cylindrotheca closterium (Ehrenberg) W. Smith; one green algae, Dunaliella tertiolecta and one cyanobacteria, Spirulina platensis (Gomont) Geitler were used to construct artificial MPB biofilms on glass fiber filters. Biofilms with a range of different MPB concentrations and different taxonomic groups were constructed, their spectral reflectances were measured with a ASD FieldSpec 3FR spectroradiometer and pigments were extracted and measured by HPLC. The best relationships between pigment concentration and second derivative spectra ($\delta$$\delta$) obtained with monospecific biofilms were: $\delta$$\delta$548 for fucoxanthin, $\delta$$\delta$590 for zeaxanthin, $\delta$$\delta$650 for chlorophyll b and $\delta$$\delta$675 for chlorophyll a. The relationship between $\delta$$\delta$590 and zeaxanthin was probably the result of covariation with phycocyanin or phycoeritrin. $\delta$$\delta$590 and $\delta$$\delta$650 were strongly affected by the presence of other taxonomic groups in the mixed species biofilms and underestimated the respective pigments, while $\delta$$\delta$548 and $\delta$$\delta$675 could be used to estimate directly fucoxanthin and chlorophyll a in taxonomically mixed biofilms. The relationship between $\delta$$\delta$675 and chlorophyll a was strongly affected by the presence of a second derivative double peak caused by chlorophyll fluorescence in the red region and was highly dependent on the smoothing amount applied to the original reflectance spectra. An alternative was proposed using the area of the second derivative peaks between 660 and 690nm (A[$\delta$$\delta$RED]). This index showed very good relationships with MPB chlorophyll a concentration and was almost insensitive to the amount of smoothing applied to the original spectra. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In order to map the spatial distribution of these species, their spectral properties have to be quantified and statistical differences between species need to be assessed. In the present study, we collected a spectral library of the key benthic macrophyte species in the Baltic Sea area and presented the methodology that allows quantifying statistical differences between their reflectance spectra. The results indicate that three broad groups of algae-green, brown, and red algae-can be separated based on their optical signatures. In general, the between-species differences are too small to allow easy recognition of benthic algae based on their untransformed reflectance spectra. However, the distinctness of the studied species and taxa improves if standardized reflectance values are used. The best indicative spectral range was at 530 to 570 nm for the separation of species and of larger taxonomic units. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The intertidal environments of estuaries represent critical exchange environments of sediment and sediment bound contaminants. Ecological and sedimentological related investigations of these environments require monitoring methods that provide rapid spatially representative data on sediment grain size distribution. Remote sensing has the potential to provide synoptic information of intertidal environments. Previous in situ and laboratory-based reflectance investigations have demonstrated that for effective quantification of sediment grain size distributions, remote sensing platforms must include measurements within the short-wave infrared (SWIR). In addition, the timing of image acquisition, in relation to tidal cycles and sediment moisture content, is critical in optimising the spectral differences between the coarser sand and finer 'mud' fraction of sediments. Daedalus 1268 Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) has been identified as an appropriate platform and sensor for providing accurate synoptic maps of estuarine sediment distributions. This paper presents the results from the application of ATM 1.75 m resolution data to the mapping of surface sediment grain-size distributions across intertidal areas of Ribble Estuary, Lancashire, UK. ATM imagery was acquired after the intertidal area was exposed to strong summer drying conditions. Pre-processing and linear unmixing of the imagery collected of the intertidal zone following a period of drying allowed accurate sub-pixel determinations (1.75 m resolution) of sediment clay (r2=0.79) but less accurate for sand (r2=0.60). The results also demonstrate deterioration in the image calibration with increasing sediment moisture content and microphytobenthos cover. However, recombining the subpixel end member abundances through multivariate regression analysis improved the image calibration significantly for both sediment clay and sand content (r2>0.8) for imagery collected in both dryer and wetter conditions. These results demonstrate that ATM data, or similar, can be used to gain quantitative information on intertidal sediment distributions and such data has application to a wide variety of estuarine research. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Kelp forests are highly productive and diverse coastal marine ecosystems which have high variability in extent and biomass spatially and through time. Mapping and monitoring their distribution is integral to understanding the ecology of kelp forests and to inform marine protected area planning. Canada's Pacific coast presents specific challenges to mapping canopy forming kelp with thousands of kilometers of coastline, complex topography, and a large tidal range. While in situ methods and manual interpretation of aerial photography are commonly used to map canopy-forming kelp at local or regional scales, these methods are prohibitively expensive for continued large-area application. Historical and current available inventories of kelp extent are therefore incomplete for Canada's Pacific Coast. The advent of Google Earth Engine, a cloud-computing platform with a repository of Landsat imagery, provides an opportunity to apply Landsat image archive analyses and integrate temporal compositing and filtering to obtain unprecedented data on historical and current kelp extents. However, the effects of the spatial resolution and temporal coverage for mapping canopy-forming kelp in regions with complex coastlines and large tidal ranges are unknown. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) develop a tool within Google Earth Engine to automate the detection of kelp using the Landsat satellite image archive, and (2) quantify the associated limitations for mapping the surface extent of canopy-forming kelp by comparing Landsat derived kelp extent with extents derived from WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The results indicate that the overall accuracy of the developed method is high at 80% and very close in accuracy to WorldView-2 data, but no detection is feasible within approximately one 30 m pixel from the shoreline. The interaction between the spatial resolution, kelp bed size, and bed configuration affected the detected kelp extent, as did the tide level during image acquisition. For both sensors, a 2 m increase in tide resulted in a 40% decrease in kelp extent detected. The Google Earth Engine kelp mapping tool presented provides an efficient and transferable method for mapping canopy kelp extent, and the only currently available method to reconstruct coast wide kelp development for the past three decades. The presented tool has applications in conservation and management planning, for example in creating a baseline of past kelp extent and examining trends in kelp forest variability.},

These indices have been widely implemented within RS applications using different airborne and satellite platforms with recent advances using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Up to date, there is no unified mathematical expression that defines all VIs due to the complexity of different light spectra combinations, instrumentation, platforms, and resolutions used. Therefore, customized algorithms have been developed and tested against a variety of applications according to specific mathematical expressions that combine visible light radiation, mainly green spectra region, from vegetation, and nonvisible spectra to obtain proxy quantifications of the vegetation surface. In the real-world applications, optimization VIs are usually tailored to the specific application requirements coupled with appropriate validation tools and methodologies in the ground. The present study introduces the spectral characteristics of vegetation and summarizes the development of VIs and the advantages and disadvantages from different indices developed. This paper reviews more than 100 VIs, discussing their specific applicability and representativeness according to the vegetation of interest, environment, and implementation precision. Predictably, research, and development of VIs, which are based on hyperspectral and UAV platforms, would have a wide applicability in different areas.},

In fact, structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry coupled with imagery acquired by UAVs offers a rapid and inexpensive tool to produce high-resolution orthomosaics, giving ecologists a new way for responsive, timely, and cost-effective monitoring of ecological processes. Here, we adopted a lightweight quadcopter as an aerial survey tool and object-based image analysis (OBIA) workflow to demonstrate the strength of such methods in producing very high spatial resolution maps of sensitive marine habitats. Therefore, three different coastal environments were mapped using the autonomous flight capability of a lightweight UAV equipped with a fully stabilized consumer-grade RGB digital camera. In particular we investigated a Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow, a rocky coast with nurseries for juvenile fish, and two sandy areas showing biogenic reefs of Sabelleria alveolata. We adopted, for the first time, UAV-based raster thematic maps of these key coastal habitats, produced after OBIA classification, as a new method for fine-scale, low-cost, and time saving characterization of sensitive marine environments which may lead to a more effective and efficient monitoring and management of natural resources.},

abstract = {For photosynthesis, phototrophic organisms necessarily synthesize not only chlorophylls but also carotenoids. Many kinds of carotenoids are found in algae and, recently, taxonomic studies of algae have been developed. In this review, the relationship between the distribution of carotenoids and the phylogeny of oxygenic phototrophs in sea and fresh water, including cyanobacteria, red algae, brown algae and green algae, is summarized. These phototrophs contain division- or class-specific carotenoids, such as fucoxanthin, peridinin and siphonaxanthin. The distribution of $\alpha$-carotene and its derivatives, such as lutein, loroxanthin and siphonaxanthin, are limited to divisions of Rhodophyta (macrophytic type), Cryptophyta, Euglenophyta, Chlorarachniophyta and Chlorophyta. In addition, carotenogenesis pathways are discussed based on the chemical structures of carotenoids and known characteristics of carotenogenesis enzymes in other organisms; genes and enzymes for carotenogenesis in algae are not yet known. Most carotenoids bind to membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes, such as reaction center, light-harvesting and cytochrome b 6f complexes. Water-soluble peridinin-chlorophyll a-protein (PCP) and orange carotenoid protein (OCP) are also established. Some functions of carotenoids in photosynthesis are also briefly summarized. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors.},

abstract = {Tidal salt marshes provide a range of ecosystem services. The most recently recognized is their provision of highly effective sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, a characteristic they share with mangroves swamps which largely replace salt marshes in the intertidal zones of tropical regions. Efforts are emerging to use salt marsh preservation or restoration in carbon offset programs, similar to the REDD initiative for tropical forests, but a number of issues first must be addressed to determine if a site meets the requirements of these programs. As intertidal systems, both salt marshes and mangrove swamps are threatened by increasing rates of sea level rise, and it will be essential to determine their sustainability, thus meeting the requirement of permanence of the carbon sink. In many areas the vegetation responsible for marsh soil accretion may not survive increased flooding periods, resulting in submergence of the marsh in its present location or inability to restore a marsh at its previous elevation. However, the marsh and its carbon sink, may survive if allowed to migrate inland. Thus assessment of permanence requires a determination if inland migration will be hindered by barriers such as high slopes or development, i.e., if the ecosystem is in a coastal squeeze. Presently, the only technology that can provide elevation models at the required vertical accuracy is Lidar, which also is extremely valuable for assessing vulnerability of coastal communities to flooding. Yet, Lidar data is not available for all coastlines, even those in the developed world. To effectively plan for the future of our coastlines requires Lidar coverage on all sensitive coastlines and its free availability for impact assessments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper addresses a number of data types and image processing techniques used to map and monitor earthquakes, faulting, volcanic activity, landslides, flooding, and wildfire, and the damages associated with each. Remote sensing is currently used operationally for some monitoring programs, though there are also difficulties associated with the rapid acquisition of data and provision of a robust product to emergency services as an end-user.

abstract={Rugulopteryx okamurae is a species of brown macroalgae belonging to the Dictyotaceae family and native to the north-western Pacific. As an Invasive Alien Species (IAS), it was first detected in the Strait of Gibraltar in 2015. Since then, R. okamurae has been spreading rapidly through the submerged euphotic zone, colonizing from 0 to 50 m depth and generating substantial economic and environmental impacts on the Andalusian coasts (southern Spain). More than 40% of marine IAS in the European Union (EU) are macroalgae, representing one of the main threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in coastal habitats. This study presents a monitoring pilot of beached R. okamurae and fresh R. okamurae down to 5 m depth in Tarifa (Cadiz, Spain), combining multispectral remote sensing data collected by sensors on-board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites, and how this information can be used to support decision-making and policy. We used an UAV flight carried out at Bolonia beach (Tarifa, Spain) on 1<sup>st</sup> July 2021 and Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) image acquisitions close to the drone flight date. In situ data were also measured on the same date of the flight, and they were used to train the supervised classification Super Vector Machine (SVM) method based on the spectral information obtained for each substrate cover. The results obtained show how multispectral images allow the detection of beached R. okamurae, and the classification accuracy for water, land vegetation, sand and R. okamurae depending on the image resolution (8.3 cm/pixel for UAV flight, 10 m/pixel for S2 and 30 m/pixel for L8). While the UAV imagery precisely delimited the area occupied by this macroalgae, satellite data were capable of detecting its presence, and able to generate early warnings. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multispectral remote sensing techniques to be incorporated in continuous monitoring programmes of the marine IAS R. okamurae in coastal areas. This information is also key to supporting regional, national and European policies in order to adapt strategic management of invasive marine macrophytes.}

abstract = {The EU Water Framework Directive1 (WFD) is an ambitious legislation framework to achieve good ecological and chemical status for all surface waters and good quantitative and chemical status for groundwater by 2027. A total of 111,062 surface waterbodies are presently reported on under the Directive, 46% of which are actively monitored for ecological status. Of these waterbodies 80% are rivers, 16% are lakes, and 4% are transitional and coastal waters. In the last assessment, 4% (4,442) of waterbodies still had unknown ecological status, while in 23% monitoring did not include in situ water sampling to support ecological status assessment2. For individual (mainly biological) assessment criteria the proportion of waterbodies without observation data is much larger; the full scope of monitoring under the WFD is therefore still far from being realised. At the same time, 60% of surface waters did not achieve ‘good' status in the second river basin management plan and waterbodies in Europe are considered to be at high risk of having poor water quality based on combined microbial, physical and physicochemical indicators3. Water quality metrics derived from satellite observation can complement conventional water sampling, particularly to achieve much improved spatial and temporal coverage of medium (several square kilometres) and larger waterbodies. Thus, it has the potential to enhance confidence in WFD ecological status classification, firstly by quantifying elements of environmental status that are currently not or under-reported by Member States, such as the frequency, onset, duration and extent of phytoplankton blooms. Second, confidence in ecological status assessment would improve with increased representativeness of the natural diversity of waterbodies that are monitored, their inter-annual variability and water quality trends within larger waterbodies. Moreover, using standardised approaches, it would allow better comparison and standardization of water quality assessment across Member States, facilitating the management of transboundary waters in particular. Finally, by increasing spatial and temporal coverage, satellite observation is expected to enhance the effectiveness of the Programme of Measures (PoM) through early detection of deterioration, improving knowledge of the potential extent of an impact, improving monitoring of the effectiveness of PoMs and providing information to support more strategic in situ sampling. The European Union and European Space Agency currently boast the most advanced suite of satellite-based instruments designed to observe optical water quality. The Copernicus framework of sensors and services has had significant investment in recent years. Therefore, the vast majority of the cost associated with satellite-based monitoring of surface waters has already been invested.},

abstract = {The biodiversity and high productivity of coastal terrestrial and aquatic habitats are the foundation for important benefits to human societies around the world. These globally distributed habitats need frequent and broad systematic assessments, but field surveys only cover a small fraction of these areas. Satellite-based sensors can repeatedly record the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectra that contain the absorption, scattering, and fluorescence signatures of functional phytoplankton groups, colored dissolved matter, and particulate matter near the surface ocean, and of biologically structured habitats (floating and emergent vegetation, benthic habitats like coral, seagrass, and algae). These measures can be incorporated into Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), including the distribution, abundance, and traits of groups of species populations, and used to evaluate habitat fragmentation. However, current and planned satellites are not designed to observe the EBVs that change rapidly with extreme tides, salinity, temperatures, storms, pollution, or physical habitat destruction over scales relevant to human activity. Making these observations requires a new generation of satellite sensors able to sample with these combined characteristics: (1) spatial resolution on the order of 30 to 100-m pixels or smaller; (2) spectral resolution on the order of 5 nm in the visible and 10 nm in the short-wave infrared spectrum (or at least two or more bands at 1,030, 1,240, 1,630, 2,125, and/or 2,260 nm) for atmospheric correction and aquatic and vegetation assessments; (3) radiometric quality with signal to noise ratios (SNR) above 800 (relative to signal levels typical of the open ocean), 14-bit digitization, absolute radiometric calibration <2%, relative calibration of 0.2%, polarization sensitivity <1%, high radiometric stability and linearity, and operations designed to minimize sunglint; and (4) temporal resolution of hours to days. We refer to these combined specifications as H4 imaging. Enabling H4 imaging is vital for the conservation and management of global biodiversity and ecosystem services, including food provisioning and water security. An agile satellite in a 3-d repeat low-Earth orbit could sample 30-km swath images of several hundred coastal habitats daily. Nine H4 satellites would provide weekly coverage of global coastal zones. Such satellite constellations are now feasible and are used in various applications.},

abstract = {Increasing human populations around the global coastline have caused extensive loss, degradation and fragmentation of coastal ecosystems, threatening the delivery of important ecosystem services1. As a result, alarming losses of mangrove, coral reef, seagrass, kelp forest and coastal marsh ecosystems have occurred1–6. However, owing to the difficulty of mapping intertidal areas globally, the distribution and status of tidal flats—one of the most extensive coastal ecosystems—remain unknown7. Here we present an analysis of over 700,000 satellite images that maps the global extent of and change in tidal flats over the course of 33 years (1984–2016). We find that tidal flats, defined as sand, rock or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation7, occupy at least 127,921 km2 (124,286–131,821 km2, 95% confidence interval). About 70% of the global extent of tidal flats is found in three continents (Asia (44% of total), North America (15.5% of total) and South America (11% of total)), with 49.2% being concentrated in just eight countries (Indonesia, China, Australia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil and Myanmar). For regions with sufficient data to develop a consistent multi-decadal time series—which included East Asia, the Middle East and North America—we estimate that 16.02% (15.62–16.47%, 95% confidence interval) of tidal flats were lost between 1984 and 2016. Extensive degradation from coastal development1, reduced sediment delivery from major rivers8,9, sinking of riverine deltas8,10, increased coastal erosion and sea-level rise11 signal a continuing negative trajectory for tidal flat ecosystems around the world. Our high-spatial-resolution dataset delivers global maps of tidal flats, which substantially advances our understanding of the distribution, trajectory and status of these poorly known coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that parasites can influence the composition and structure of natural animal communities. In spite of this, it is difficult to assess just how important parasitism is for community structure because very few studies have been designed specifically to address the role of parasites at the community level, no doubt because it is difficult to manipulate the abundance of parasites in field experiments. Here, we bring together a large amount of published information on parasitism in intertidal communities to highlight the potential influence of parasites on the structure and biodiversity of these communities. We first review the impact of metazoan parasites on the survival, reproduction, growth and behaviour of intertidal invertebrates, from both rocky shores and soft-sediment flats. Published evidence suggests that the impact of parasites on individuals is often severe, though their effects at the population level are dependent on prevalence and intensity of infection. We then put this information together in a discussion of the impact of parasitism at the community level. We emphasize two ways in which parasites can modify the structure of intertidal communities. First, the direct impact of parasites on the abundance of key host species can decrease the importance of these hosts in competition or predator-prey interactions with other species. Second, the indirect effects of parasites on the behaviour of their hosts, e.g. burrowing ability or spatial distribution within the intertidal zone, can cause changes to various features of the habitat for other intertidal species, leading to their greater settlement success or to their local disappearance. Our synthesis allows specific predictions to be made regarding the potential impact of parasites in certain intertidal systems, and suggests that parasites must be included in future community studies and food web models of intertidal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Seagrasses, flowering marine plants that form underwater meadows, play a significant global role in supporting food security, mitigating climate change and supporting biodiversity. Although progress is being made to conserve seagrass meadows in select areas, most meadows remain under significant pressure resulting in a decline in meadow condition and loss of function. Effective management strategies need to be implemented to reverse seagrass loss and enhance their fundamental role in coastal ocean habitats. Here we propose that seagrass meadows globally face a series of significant common challenges that must be addressed from a multifaceted and interdisciplinary perspective in order to achieve global conservation of seagrass meadows. The six main global challenges to seagrass conservation are (1) a lack of awareness of what seagrasses are and a limited societal recognition of the importance of seagrasses in coastal systems; (2) the status of many seagrass meadows are unknown, and up-to-date information on status and condition is essential; (3) understanding threatening activities at local scales is required to target management actions accordingly; (4) expanding our understanding of interactions between the socio-economic and ecological elements of seagrass systems is essential to balance the needs of people and the planet; (5) seagrass research should be expanded to generate scientific inquiries that support conservation actions; (6) increased understanding of the linkages between seagrass and climate change is required to adapt conservation accordingly. We also explicitly outline a series of proposed policy actions that will enable the scientific and conservation community to rise to these challenges. We urge the seagrass conservation community to engage stakeholders from local resource users to international policy-makers to address the challenges outlined here, in order to secure the future of the world's seagrass ecosystems and maintain the vital services which they supply.},

It is well known that $\beta$-carotene can be overproduced in the green microalga Dunaliella salina in response to stressful light conditions. However, little is known about the effects of light quality on carotenoid metabolism, e.g., narrow spectrum red light. In this study, we present UPLC-UV-MS data from D. salina consistent with the pathway proposed for carotenoid metabolism in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We have studied the effect of red light-emitting diode (LED) lighting on growth rate and biomass yield and identified the optimal photon flux for D. salina growth. We found that the major carotenoids changed in parallel to the chlorophyll b content and that red light photon stress alone at high level was not capable of upregulating carotenoid accumulation presumably due to serious photodamage. We have found that combining red LED (75 %) with blue LED (25 %) allowed growth at a higher total photon flux. Additional blue light instead of red light led to increased $\beta$-carotene and lutein accumulation, and the application of long-term iterative stress (adaptive laboratory evolution) yielded strains of D. salina with increased accumulation of carotenoids under combined blue and red light. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The significant role seagrass meadows play in supporting fisheries productivity and food security across the globe is not adequately reflected in the decisions made by authorities with statutory responsibility for their management. We provide a unique global analysis of three data sources to present the case for why seagrass meadows need targeted policy to recognize and protect their role in supporting fisheries production and food security. (1) Seagrass meadows provide valuable nursery habitat to over 1/5th of the world's largest 25 fisheries, including Walleye Pollock, the most landed species on the planet. (2) In complex small-scale fisheries from around the world (poorly represented in fisheries statistics), we present evidence that many of those in proximity to seagrass are supported to a large degree by these habitats. (3) We reveal how intertidal fishing activity in seagrass is a global phenomenon, often directly supporting human livelihoods. Our study demonstrates that seagrasses should be recognized and managed to maintain and maximize their role in global fisheries production. The chasm that exists between coastal habitat conservation and fisheries management needs to be filled to maximize the chances of seagrass meadows supporting fisheries, so that they can continue to support human wellbeing.},

abstract = {Seagrass meadows are undergoing significant decline locally and globally from human and climatic impacts. Seagrass decline also impacts seagrass-dependent macrofauna benthic activ-ity, interrupts their vital linkage with adjacent habitats, and creates broader degradation through the ecosystem. Seagrass variability (gain and loss) is a driver of marine species diversity. Still, our understanding of macrofauna benthic activity distribution and their response to seagrass variability from remotely sensed drone imagery is limited. Hence, it is critical to develop fine-scale seasonal change detection techniques appropriate to the scale of variability that will apply to dynamic marine environments. Therefore, this research tested the performance of the VIS and VIS+NIR sensors from proximal low altitude remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) to detect fine-scale seasonal seagrass variability using spectral indices and a supervised machine learning classification technique. Fur-thermore, this research also attempted to identify and quantify macrofauna benthic activity from their feeding burrows and their response to seagrass variability. The results from VIS (visible spec-trum) and VIS+NIR (visible and near-infrared spectrum) sensors produced a 90–98% classification accuracy. This accuracy established that the spectral indices were fundamental in this study to identify and classify seagrass density. The other important finding revealed that seagrass-associated macrofauna benthic activity showed increased or decreased abundance and distribution with seasonal seagrass variability from drone high spatial resolution orthomosaics. These results are important for seagrass conservation because managers can quickly detect fine-scale seasonal changes and take mitigation actions before the decline of this keystone species affects the entire ecosystem. Moreover, proximal low-altitude, remotely sensed time-series seasonal data provided valuable con-tributions for documenting spatial ecological seasonal change in this dynamic marine environment.},

abstract = {Intertidal seagrasses often occupy areas of high ecological importance that are also targeted for human activities, such as shellfishing and leisure walking. These activities could affect the growth or survival of seagrass. The society at large lacks knowledge of the ecological relevance of seagrasses and their vulnerability, presenting an obstacle for their conservation. Here, the Oka estuary (Basque Country, N. Spain) is used as a case study to analyse the spatial extent of shellfishing activities in seagrass (Zostera noltei). This estuary holds 84% of the intertidal seagrass meadows present in the Basque Country and is visited during the year by professional and recreational shellfishers. Bait digging is legal year-round, and clam digging (by professionals only) from October to February. Human presence over 11 years averaged 17 people on the tidal flat in each daylight hours from August to October. Each professional shellfishing daily trip affected 7.4–21.6 m2 by fishing and 110–188 m2 by trampling in seagrass, but was substantially different between clam and bait (crustacean, worm) fishing. Scaling up this area to estimated annual number of shellfishers, 8–69% of the total seagrass area is trampled and 1–9% is dug per year. In comparison to a habitat suitability map for seagrass, 98% of trampling occurred within a very highly suitable area for seagrass presence (i.e., >90%). This pressure could adversely affect seagrass density and prevent the expansion of meadows into areas suitable for seagrass. Management of public impacts to seagrass in this estuary could occur through prohibition of some activities in seagrass and awareness campaigns among shellfishers and walkers.},

abstract = {Diatoms are widely distributed in many temperate areas and some species frequently form extensive blooms in spring. Hence, monitoring the variations of specific genera or species of diatoms is necessary for studying phytoplankton population dynamics in marine ecosystems. To test whether pigment ratios can be used to identify diatoms at a below-class taxonomic level, we analyzed 14 species/strains of diatoms isolated from Chinese seas using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We normalized all pigment concentrations to total chlorophyll a to calculate the ratios of pigment to chlorophyll a, and calculated the ratios between accessory pigments (or pigment sums). Cluster analysis indicated that these diatoms could be classified into four clusters in terms of three accessory pigment ratios: chlorophyll c 2: chlorophyll c 1, fucoxanthin:total chlorophyll c and diadinoxanthin:diatoxanthin. The classification results matched well with those of biological taxonomy. To test the stability of the classification, pigment data from one species, cultured under different light intensities, and five new species/strains were calculated and used for discriminant analysis. The results show that the classification of diatom species using pigment ratio suites was stable for the variations of pigment ratios of species cultured in different light intensities. The introduction of new species, however, may confuse the classification within the current scheme. Classification of marine diatoms using pigment ratio suites is potentially valuable for the fine chemotaxonomy of phytoplankton at taxonomic levels below class and would advance studies on phytoplankton population dynamics and marine ecology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

How these changes impact coastal marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is not well known. In this study, we examined the potential impacts of habitat changes by comparing species commonality and community structure (i.e., species richness, abundance, and functional composition) among artificial (a breakwater wall) and natural habitats (eelgrass bed, intertidal flat, and subtidal bottom) within a semi-enclosed coastal sea impacted by marine urbanization. We found considerable species overlap (i.e., high species sharing) among the eelgrass bed, intertidal flat, and subtidal bottom habitats. By contrast, the breakwater wall was a distinctive habitat with little overlap in species and functional groups with the other habitats, and was therefore a poor substitute for natural habitats. Our study suggests that marine urbanization degrades redundancy and inhibits the maintenance of biodiversity in coastal marine zones.},

abstract = {Our geochemical analysis conducted in the northern coast of the city of Sfax (Tunisia) shows signs of organic and mineral loads which are particularly enriched with heavy metals and nutritive salts. The study of the distribution of certain selected heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Ni and Zn) within surface sediments reveals that this coast is extremely polluted. This situation appears as the result of the following multiple factors: (a) «the enrichment factor» assigned to the negative impact of the pollution sources, especially the phosphogypsum terril; (b) «the nature of the substratum and the state of the ecosystem», caused by the existence of mud wich is enriched with organic matter; (c) «the low hydrodynamism of the marine waters», explained by combined effects due to slow currents of sea water and the presence of a relatively sheltered bay close to the phosphogypsum terril. These factors resulted in threatening the biodiversity of coastal fauna and flora living in this part of the Pelagian Sea. Certain species are developed along the coastline (highly polluted) and others in the offshore (qualified as risk zone). The principal component analysis evidence the biologic delineation of two distinct environments: The uppermost intertidal zone which is a confined zone strongly threatened by anthropic effluents. It is characterized by the abundance of green algae, different types of bivalves [Cardium glaucum, Scrobicularia plana) and gasteropods [Cerithium vulgatum, Littorina sp., Turritetla communis).

abstract = {Understanding the resilience and recovery processes of coastal marine ecosystems is of increasing importance in the face of increasing disturbances and stressors. Large-scale, catastrophic events can re-set the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and potentially lead to different stable states. Such an event occurred in south-eastern New Zealand when a Mw 7.8 earthquake lifted the coastline by up to 6 m. This caused widespread mortality of intertidal algal and invertebrate communities over 130 km of coast. This study involved structured and detailed sampling of three intertidal zones at 16 sites nested into four degree of uplift (none, 0.4–1, 1.5–2.5, and 4.5–6 m). Recovery of large brown algal assemblages, the canopy species of which were almost entirely fucoids, were devastated by the uplift, and recovery after 4 years was generally poor except at sites with < 1 m of uplift. The physical infrastructural changes to reefs were severe, with intertidal emersion temperatures frequently above 35°C and up to 50°C, which was lethal to remnant populations and recruiting algae. Erosion of the reefs composed of soft sedimentary rocks was severe. Shifting sand and gravel covered some lower reef areas during storms, and the nearshore light environment was frequently below compensation points for algal production, especially for the largest fucoid Durvillaea antarctica/poha. Low uplift sites recovered much of their pre-earthquake assemblages, but only in the low tidal zone. The mid and high tidal zones of all uplifted sites remained depauperate. Fucoids recruited well in the low zone of low uplift sites but then were affected by a severe heat wave a year after the earthquake that reduced their cover. This was followed by a great increase in fleshy red algae, which then precluded recruitment of large brown algae. The interactions of species' life histories and the altered physical and ecological infrastructure on which they rely are instructive for attempts to lessen manageable stressors in coastal environments and help future-proof against the effects of compounded impacts.},

abstract = {Ecosystem engineering by organisms is a central determinant of multifunctionality in marine sedimentary systems. However, global warming can alter this multifunctionality, by modifying engineer co-existence and the diversity of functional traits present in a landscape. This is mediated by warming favoring retention of traits of tolerant engineers over sensitive ones and functional characteristics of residents nested within engineered patches. This study aims to test the influence of warming on co-existence of two sympatric autogenic engineers (seagrass Zostera capensis and red macroalga Gracilaria gracilis) that co-occur in intertidal sandflats of Langebaan Lagoon, on the west coast of South Africa. Findings from mesocosm experiments indicate that increasing temperature to maximum levels recorded in situ is linked to greater seagrass senescence (80–93%) and epiphytic fouling (80–86%) relative to low temperatures. Warming was associated with greater biomass of G. gracilis (30–45%) relative to controls, despite it incurring greater fouling levels (55–60%) and potentially light reduction. In situ comparisons of functional traits and community metrics of macrofauna inhabiting beds of Zostera and Gracilaria and unvegetated sandflats, indicated unique assemblages in Zostera habitats and a dominance of surface-dwelling fauna. Macrofaunal abundance was reduced in Gracilaria beds (72%) and unvegetated sandflats (47%), which were dominated by burrowing infauna. Findings indicate that warming in temperate coastal systems may lead to seagrass declines, but increased cover of G. gracilis. This shift would likely lower ecosystem heterogeneity, given the faunal similarity between unvegetated sandflats and Gracilaria beds that was recorded, while reducing habitat for critically endangered specialist seagrass inhabitants.},

abstract = {Understanding the connectivity among seascape habitats is an important emerging topic in marine ecology and coastal management. Mangroves are known to provide many ecosystem services such as coastal protection and carbon cycling, but their functional relationships with adjacent benthic intertidal communities are less clear. We examined how spatial adjacency to mangroves affects macrobenthic communities of intertidal mudflats in a tropical estuarine ecosystem. In the Bijag{\'{o}}s Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau, benthic macrofauna assemblages were compared among sampling locations with different connectivities between intertidal mudflats and mangrove stands. We explored how a single mangrove connectivity index (MCI), combining mangrove tidal basin size and the distance to the mangrove edge, affected macrobenthic composition, and compared this effect to sediment properties. In addition, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) and ordination to determine how different environmental predictors directly and indirectly affected macrobenthic communities. MCI strongly affected macrobenthic composition and species abundance, and SEM revealed that this effect contained both a direct component and an indirect component through mudflat NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index, an indicator for microphytobenthos). Sediment properties (grain size, organic matter) affected macrobenthos independently from MCI, nevertheless sediment properties were also affected by MCI. We show the importance of accounting for the seascape structure of tidal basins when investigating the connectivity between mangroves and macrobenthic communities of intertidal mudflats. As benthic macrofauna is a key food source for endangered fish and waders in these systems, our findings provide strong arguments for the integrative conservation of intertidal mudflats and mangroves at the seascape scale.},

Fragment and fiber dominance (16–92% and 6–81% respectively) and color-shape category diversity varied significantly by site. Distance-based linear models demonstrated that estuary-wide, mean grain size and mud were the best predictors of MP abundance-diversity matrices, but variance explained was low (9%). Relationships were improved when the data was split into sandy and muddy habitats. In sandy habitats (<8% mud), physical properties of the bed (mean grain size, mud content and distance from the estuary mouth) were still selected as predictors of MP abundance-diversity (14% variance explained); but a number of bivariate relationships were detected with biochemical properties such as BMA associated pigments and organic matter. In muddy habitats (>8% mud), porewater ammonium was lower when fiber abundance and overall MP diversity were higher. The inclusion of porewater ammonium, organic matter content and pheophytins alongside physical properties explained a greater percentage of the variance in MP abundance-diversity for muddy habitats (21%). The results highlight the importance of examining plastic shapes and MP categories in addition to abundance and emphasize that functionally different habitats should be examined separately to increase our understanding of MP-biota-function relationships.},

abstract = {Although wild oyster reefs are invasive and are trophic competitors, they are an essential component of intertidal rocky reef systems that support a wide range of biodiversity in some intertidal estuaries. Despite their importance, their population locally and globally are declining, reflecting variations such as increased predation and anthropogenic influence in an estuary, such as excessive nutrients discharge. In addition, spatial assessment and mapping wild oyster reefs can be challenging due to complex and rugged structures that are challenging to access using conventional in-situ, time-extensive techniques. Therefore, the application of remote sensing for ecology and conservation of benthic habitats has emerged as a powerful technique to expedite many challenges. This study investigated VIS (visible spectrum) and VIS+NIR (visible + near-infrared spectrum) remote sensing for spatial assessment and mapping wild oyster reefs in a rocky intertidal reef at low tide. In addition, the study assessed the spectral reflectance signatures of wild oyster reefs from RPAS aerial imagery to in-situ spectral signatures. Although the VIS orthomosaic had a higher spatial resolution, wild oyster reefs detection was less efficient. In contrast, oyster reefs were correctly classified in the VIS+NIR imagery achieving an overall accuracy of 85%. This accuracy implies that the spectral resolution has been more critical to detect and correctly classify oyster reefs than spatial resolution. This remote sensing technique for ecology and conservation offers scale-appropriate spatial assessment, monitoring, and mapping of benthic habitats in challenging and inaccessible marine environments. Furthermore, this technique can be complemented with in-situ and other remote sensing datasets to enhance our understanding of the spatial dynamics of near-shore marine environments.},

abstract = {Intertidal ecosystems are key habitats that are being replaced by artificial hard substrates due to the increment of human activities in coastal areas. These new substrates host generally less biodiversity mainly due to differences in complexity and composition. This is a global phenomenon and has led to the development of strategies in the framework of eco-engineering. However, mitigating measures, such as new eco-designs, must cope with the high spatial variability of the region where they are applied. Therefore, in order to assess if differences in biodiversity detected at local scales in previous studies could be scaled up to predict patterns at a wider scale, we studied taxa richness and taxonomic structure of intertidal communities across the Alboran Sea (western Mediterranean Sea). We compared four different types of artificial substrates (cubes, rip-raps, seawalls and tetrapods) to assess which produces less impact. Overall, artificial substrates host low benthic biodiversity, specially on seawalls, whereas boulder-like artificial structures such as rip-raps were more similar to natural ones. Nevertheless, the effect of a particular type of artificial structure at a regional scale seems unpredictable, highlighting the challenge that eco-engineering measures face in order to establish global protocols for biodiversity enhancement and the importance of local scale in management programmes.},

abstract = {Estuarine intertidal sediments are colonized by photosynthetic microorganisms grouped under the generic term of microphytobenthos (MPB). These microbial assemblages form transient biofilms at the sediment surface and have important ecosystem functions. MPB biofilms are well known to exhibit high microscale patchiness whereas meso- and macroscale spatio-temporal structures are little known. In this work, satellite remote sensing was used to map MPB assemblages at such scales. MPB interannual distribution was investigated in the poly- and mesohaline domain of the north-European estuary (Loire estuary), using a multispectral SPOT image time series (1991-2009). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from two SPOT channels, XS2 and XS3, (red and near-infrared wavelengths, respectively). MPB biofilms were identified by NDVI values between 0 and 0.3. At the scale of the whole intertidal area, the results showed that MPB biofilms in the Loire estuary exhibited perennial structures in both the polyhaline and mesohaline sectors, occupying nearly 90% of the mudflat surfaces. MPB biofilm density was closely associated with intertidal position, with thicker biofilms developing mostly in the upper and middle shore, and formed kilometric longitudinal structures parallel to the shoreline. Mean NDVI values showed a strong positive correlation with mean seasonal air temperature (. $\tau$ = 0.714, p < 0.05 in the polyhaline domain and $\tau$ = 0.810, p < 0.05 in the mesohaline domain), with a strong correlation in the upper intertidal mudflat (between +3 and 4 m isobaths). Negative wind effect was mainly detected in the upper intertidal areas, particularly between the +3 and 4 m isobaths (. $\tau$ = -0.810, p < 0.05 in the polyhaline domain and $\tau$ = -0.910 in the mesohaline).},

abstract = {Remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation uses a wide range of vegetation indices (VIs) to monitor plant characteristics, but these indices can be very sensitive to canopy background reflectance. This study investigated background influences on VIs applied to intertidal microphytobenthos, using a synthetic spectral library constituted by a spectral combination of three contrasting types of sediment (sand, fine sand, and mud) and reflectance spectra of benthic diatom monospecific cultures obtained in controlled conditions. The spectral database exhibited, for the same biomass range (3-182 mg chlorophyll am-2), marked differences in albedo and spectral contrast linked to sediment variability in water content, grain size, and organic matter content. Several VIs were evaluated, from ratios using visible and near infrared wavelengths, to hyperspectral indices (derivative analysis, continuum removal). Among the ratios, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) appeared less sensitive to background effects than VIs with soil corrections such as the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Modified second Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) or the Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI). The lower efficacy of soil-corrected VIs may be explained by the structural differences and optical behavior of soil vs. canopies compared to sediment vs. microphytobenthos biofilms. The background effects were minimized using Modified Gaussian Model indices at 632 nm and 675 nm, and the second derivative at 632 nm, while poor results were obtained with the red-edge inflection point (REIP) and the second derivative at 675 nm. The least sensitive index was the Phytobenthos Index which is very similar to the NDVI, but uses a red wavelength at 632 nm instead of 675 nm, to account for the absorption by chlorophyll c. The modified NDVI705, where the 705 nm wavelength replaces the red band, showed moderate background sensitivity. Moreover, the NDVI705 and the Phytobenthos Index have the additional relevant property of being less sensitive to the index saturation response with increasing biomass. Unfortunately, these VIs cannot be applied to broad-band multispectral satellite images, and require sensors with a hyperspectral resolution. Nevertheless, this study showed that the background influence was not a limitation to applying the ubiquitous NDVI to map intertidal microphytobenthos using multispectral satellite images. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Remote sensing could provide a tool for mapping bottom vegetation if the substrates are spectrally resolvable. We measured reflectance spectra of green (Cladophora glomerata), red (Furcellaria lumbricalis), and brown (Fucus vesiculosus) macroalgae and used a bio-optical model in estimating whether these algae distinguish optically from each other, from sandy bottom or deep water in turbid water conditions of the Baltic Sea. The simulation was carried out for three different water types: (1) CDOM-rich coastal water, (2) coastal waters not directly impacted by high CDOM discharge from rivers but with high concentration of cyanobacteria, (3) open Baltic waters. Our modelling results indicate that the reflectance spectra of C. glomerata, F. lumbricalis, F. vesiculosus differ from each other and also from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. The differences are detectable by remote sensing instruments at spectral resolution of 10 nm and SNR better than 1000:1. Thus, the lowest depth limits where the studied macroalgae grow do not exceed the depth where such remote sensing instruments could potentially detect the spectral differences between the studied species. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A simple Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) effectively discriminated the presence of vegetation floating on the sea surface. The Sargassum Index derived from reflectance ratios at 650 and 630. nm was used to effectively discriminate Sargassum from Syringodium wrack. Mesocosm spectral measurements revealed an initial lowering of wrack reflectance over the first 3. days followed by a subsequent increase in reflectance over the next 8. days. The age of the wrack estimated from 2 to 5. days was best characterized using narrowband indices of the water absorption feature at 930 and 990. nm potentially from increasing water content in wrack leaves over time. Hyperspectral imagery (<10 nm) was necessary to differentiate between these two types of floating vegetation and assess age of the wrack. PRISM imagery revealed seagrass wrack organized in 5-35. m spaced windrows caused by Langmuir circulation. Wrack was only detectable at 60. m. pixel resolution when densities were high and individual windrows were in close proximity.},

abstract = {This study was conducted in subtidal areas around Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas, to investigate how microalgal biomass and community structure affect hyperspectral reflectance of sediments. Hyperspectral reflectance was measured on the surfaces of sediment cores collected from several types of carbonate sediments and habitats. Subsequently, photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments within the microalgae colonizing the top 5 mm of the sediment cores were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results of pigment analyses indicate that both microalgal biomass and community structure varied within and among sampling sites. Examination of spectral reflectance revealed differences both in the magnitude of overall reflectance between 400 and 710 nm and in the magnitude of absorption features. Second derivative analysis of reflectance spectra was used to identify nine narrow wavebands that correspond to wavelengths most affected by in vivo absorption by specific pigments. Results of linear regression analyses of the ratio of second derivatives at 676 nm to reflectance at 676 nm versus chlorophyll a plus chlorophyllide a indicate that total (living plus senescent or dead) microalgal biomass can be estimated from measurements of hyperspectral reflectance. Estimates of microalgal biomass can also be made based on the ratios of second derivatives at 444 nm to reflectance at 444 nm. Concentrations of other pigment groups can be estimated from second derivatives at 492 and 540 nm. These relationships between hyperspectral reflectance of sediments and benthic microalgal pigments suggest that remote sensing reflectance might be useful for distinguishing major differences among benthic habitats in some optically shallow areas.},

As such areas, particularly mudflats of limited access for point sampling, remote sensing techniques have the potential to map diatom biomass. This study used two monospecific cultures of the benthic diatoms Navicula ramosissima and Entomoneis paludosa, isolated from mudflats in Bourgneuf Bay (France), to obtain a biomass range. Exponential and senescent stages of microalgal growth were also tested. The objective was to relate the spectral reflectance obtained by spectroradiometry to the composition and amount of principal and accessory pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Analysis of pigments vs. chlorophyll a ratios revealed differences between these two diatom species, mainly due to fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin. These interspecific variations among the class of Bacillariophyceae were also detected by spectroradiometry. No differences were observed between the two growth stages, and cell senescence had no effects on spectral properties. The chlorophyll pigments used to establish a relationship between diatom biomass and spectral reflectance gave the most interesting results for an absorption band at 632 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c. This band, contrary to that at 673 nm related to chlorophyll a only and traditionally used for biomass estimations in green plants, provided the largest range of variations and was not saturated at a high biomass concentration. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Seagrasses are marine plants ranked worldwide amongst the most valuable coastal ecosystems. The global conservation effort requires accurate estimation of seagrass abundance and taxonomic composition. Hyperspectral reflectance has been used to estimate seagrass biomass, despite requiring destructive laboratory measurements that goes against conservation principles. Therefore, we assessed the efficiency of Zostera noltei hyperspectral reflectance to estimate its aboveground biomass in intertidal areas, having Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal) as a case study, with seasonal samplings during a whole year comparing (non-destructive) field- and (destructive) laboratory-based measurements of the spectral signature. Several vegetation indices (VIs) that focus on the spectral absorption of specific pigments were also tested: Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI)-like ratios, Double Difference (DD)-like Ratios and Simple Ratios (SR). Here we show that Z. noltei hyperspectral signature, measured in the field and in the laboratory, is clearly related to the aboveground biomass of the plant along the year. We found that among the VIs, NDVI-like ratios showed higher correlation with Z. noltei aboveground biomass than the other types of VIs. Taking into consideration the sensitivity to biomass saturation, the NDVI705 was identified as the best vegetation index to estimate Z. noltei biomass during the whole year and in both type of measurements, up to a saturation level, also demonstrating the successful use of non-destructive methods. The suitability of hyperspectral reflectance measurements in order to estimate Z. noltei aboveground biomass was confirmed, confirming also the potential efficient use of field-based measurements (non-destructive) for conservation practices and sustainable management of the species in intertidal ecosystems and allowing aboveground biomass to be potentially proposed as a metric for the evaluation of seagrass healthy condition under EU policies (e.g. Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive).},

Amongst nearshore ecosystems, seagrass beds play a major role enhancing biodiversity and water quality. Consequently, the development of new approaches to create extensive and high-resolution habitat maps is required not only to implement conservation, restoration and management plans, but also to establish adaptation plans to face climate change impacts. This study particularly assesses the capability of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, with special focus on Zostera noltii seagrass meadows. To this end, 13 habitats were defined along the supralittoral, intertidal and subtidal zones of an estuary, including Z.noltii seagrass meadows. The CASI sensor was configured to acquire 25 bands in the visible and near infrared wavelengths with a ground sampling distance of 2 m. Spectral bands were selected for species discrimination based on the spectral signature of the different habitat classes. Six different band combinations were tested applying maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The most accurate classification was obtained with 10 band combination (a mean producer accuracy 92% and a mean user accuracy 94%). The classification of Z.noltii beds has been found to be restricted to moderate and high dense meadows, however a vegetation index has been defined which could be applied for mapping Z. noltii meadow cover. These results highlight the value of CASI data to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, providing key information to be used in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, protection and conservation of coastal habitats.},

The library includes species collected in the Atlantic Patagonian coast (Argentina) with representatives of brown, red, and green algae, being 22 of the species included in a spectral library for the first time. The spectra of these main groups are described, and the intraspecific variability is also assessed, considering kelp differentiated tissues and depth range, discussing them from the point of view of their effects on spectral features. A classification and an independent component analysis using the spectral range and simulated bands of two state-of-the-art drone-borne hyperspectral sensors were performed. The results show spectral features and clusters identifying further algae taxonomic groups, showing the potential applications of this spectral library for drone-based mapping of this ecological and economical asset of our coastal marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Since 2008, macroalgal blooms of Ulva prolifera (also called green tides) occurred every summer in the Yellow Sea (YS), causing environmental and economic problems. A number of studies have used satellite observations to estimate the severity of the blooms through estimating the bloom size and duration. However, a critical bloom parameter, namely biomass, has never been objectively determined due to lack of measurements. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to measure U. prolifera biomass (wet weight) per unit area and the corresponding spectral reflectance, through which a robust relationship has been established to link biomass per area to the reflectance-based floating algae index (FAI). The lab-based model has been validated with in situ measurements, with an estimated relative uncertainty of < 16% for algae with FAI values < 0.2 (corresponding to $\sim$ 2 kg/m2 biomass and accounting for > 99.5% of the algae-containing pixels in satellite images). The model was further transferred to MODIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc), where aerosol impacts on the model were simulated under various atmospheric conditions. The simulations showed an average of 6.5% (up to 12.3% for the extreme case) uncertainties in biomass estimates when MODIS Rrc data were used as the model inputs. The dry biomass per wet biomass and carbon and nitrogen contents per dry biomass were also determined through lab experiments, thus making their estimation possible from MODIS Rrc data. The model was then applied to time-series of MODIS observations over the YS between 2008 and 2015 to determine the inter-annual variability of these critical parameters. Results showed maximum daily biomass of > 1.7 million tons during June 2015 and minimum daily biomass of < 0.09 million tons during 2012. The ability to estimate U. prolifera biomass at given locations from the near real-time MODIS images is expected to significantly enhance the capacity of an existing monitoring system to provide quantitative information for decision making.},

abstract = {Estimating biomass of microphytobenthos (MPB) on intertidal mud flats is extremely difficult due to their patchy occurrence, especially at the scale of an entire mud flat. We tested two optical approaches that can be applied in situ: spectral reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence. These two approaches were applied in 4 European estuaries with different sediment characteristics. At each site, paired replicate measurements of hyperspectral reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence (after 15 min dark adaptation, Fo15), sediment water content, and chlorophyll a concentrations were taken (including breakdown products: [chl a + phaeo]). Sediments were further characterized by grain size and organic content analysis. The spectral signatures of tidal flats dominated by benthic microalgae, mainly diatoms, could be easily distinguished from sites dominated by macrophytes; we present a 3 waveband algorithm that can be used to detect the presence of macrophytes. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was found to be most strongly correlated to sediment [chl a + phaeo], except for the predominantly sandy Sylt stations. Fo15 was also significantly correlated to sediment [chl a + phaeo] in all but one grid (Sylt grid A). Our results suggest that the functional relationships (i.e., the slopes) between NDVI or fluorescence and [chl a + phaeo] were not significantly different in the muddier grids, although the intercepts could differ significantly, especially for Fo15. This suggests a mismatch of the optical depth seen by the reflectometer or fluorometer and the depth sampled for pigment analysis. NDVI appears to be a robust proxy for sediment [chl a + phaeo] and can be used to quantify MPB biomass in muddy sediments of mid latitude estuaries. {\textcopyright} 2006 Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract = {Intertidal macroalgal communities mark the boundary of the marine realm and are faced with many direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures. The effective and sustainable management of these resources must be underpinned by accurate, efficient and cost-effective environmental data collection. Traditional field survey methods, whilst accurate, are time-consuming and limited in the area that can be covered. Remote sensing permits large areas to be rapidly surveyed but the effectiveness of satellites and aircraft for mapping fine-scale intertidal macroalgal mapping is limited by their coarse spatial resolution and restricted operational flexibility. The rapid development of unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) and sensor technology can address these issues and provide a potential alternative to established remote sensing platforms. Here, a detailed methodology is presented for the assessment of the commercially and ecologically important intertidal brown macroalga Ascophyllum nodosum using a multirotor UAV and pushbroom hyperspectral sensor. Two different classifiers, Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), were compared along with two different sources of spectral profiles, one collected in-situ with a spectral radiometer and the other derived from hyperspectral imagery. Of the classifiers compared, both trained using image-derived spectra, MLC more accurately classified A. nodosum, and other common intertidal species and substratum (Overall Accuracy (OA) 94.7%) than SAM (OA 81.1%). In addition, SAM, trained using in-situ spectra, was the least accurate of the three classifier workflows used (OA 71.4%). The low accuracy of the spectral radiometer approach was likely due to high levels of noise present in the hyperspectral data, a result of the relative instability of the UAV platform causing vibration. The accurate mapping of non-target species also highlights the applicability of this methodology for a broader range of intertidal macroalgal species and communities. This research clearly demonstrates the potential of UAV-mounted hyperspectral remote sensing for mapping the spatially and spectral complex macroalgal habitats found within the intertidal zone.},

abstract = {The recent introduction of portable, low-cost hyperspectral radiometers for measuring the reflectance of marine intertidal habitats has considerable promise, first as a source of reference spectra for airborne and satellite remote sensing, and second as a survey technique in its own right. This paper reports on the results of an intercalibration exercise in which two designs of commercially available instruments were used to measure reflectance spectra across a diverse, intertidal site. The substrates sampled included seagrasses, macroalgae, and sediments which varied in wetness and grain size. Spectra were compared statistically using several measures of similarity, and the results showed a high degree of correlation between the measured reflectance spectra. There were no significant differences between instruments from different manufacturers in the shape of reflectance spectra, but the signal-to-noise ratio varied considerably between individual instruments. Spectra measured by operators with lesser experience in field spectrometry tended to be more variable than those of more experienced operators, indicating that training and adherence to set protocols are important when implementing this method in the field situation. Spatial plots derived from field spectra showed essentially the same trends in surface features as plots created using traditional sampling and remote sensing methods. Furthermore, the use of field spectrometry as a stand-alone, low-cost method for rapidly mapping the distribution of major habitat types was demonstrated by the results of a survey of a large intertidal sandbank.},

abstract = {Benthic algal cover and trends in its changes are indicators of water state in coastal areas. Mapping benthic algal cover with conventional methods (diving) provides great accuracy and high resolution yet is very expensive and is limited by the time and manpower necessary to monitor large bodies of water and long stretches of coastline. Mapping of benthic macroalgal cover by remote sensing requires knowledge about optical signatures of different bottom types. We measured reflectance spectra of red, green, and brown macroalgae, seagrass, sand, pebble, and wet and dry decaying mats of macroalgae and higher plants. Comparing optical properties of the Baltic Sea macro- algae with results of other studies from different parts of the world allows us to conclude that reflectances of three large groups (red, green, and brown algae) are relatively consistent in shape. Most of the variability within the groups occurs in reflectance values. The within-species variability in reflectance values of the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus and the red alga Furcellaria lumbricalis is as great as the variability in reflectance values within brown and red algae groups, correspondingly. This suggests that the feasibility of mapping the benthic macroalgal cover in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea by remote sensing on species level is highly unlikely. The collected spectral library of the Baltic Sea bottom types allows us to interpret remote sensing data using supervised classifi- cation methods, such as Spectral Angle Mapper, which require availability of reflectance spectra of different bottom types. The spectral library together with a bio-optical model allows estimating the suitability of different remote sensing sensors for mapping Baltic Sea bottom types. Thus, collecting the spectral library is an important step in mapping shallow water bottom types by remote sensing.},

abstract = {In principle, a priori knowledge of organism-scale spectral signatures for key ecological end-members is a basic requirement for identifying coral reef benthic communities using hyperspectral remotely-sensed imagery. Spectral signatures of end-members are now relatively well known for predominant reef taxa (coral, algae) and for the background of the living communities (e.g. sediments). What remains unclear is whether the criteria for spectral discrimination between end-members at the millimeter or centimeter scale remain valid when attempting to process images at several meters resolution. In other words, is it possible to scale-up spectral criteria of identification from species/organisms to communities? We address this issue with in situ and 'compact airborne spectrometer imager' (CASI) hyperspectral measurements of the tropical marine flora of 2 South Pacific Ocean coral reefs. Targets were the dominant algal species and communities encountered in the shallow (0 to 3 m) barrier and fringing reefs of Moorea Island and the outer margin of the rim of Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia), Stepwise wavelength selection and linear discriminant analysis highlighted the key non-redundant wavelengths necessary to achieve good separation between the predefined ecological groups. Comparison of the wavelengths identified from in situ and airborne measurements allowed definition of a subset of common wavelengths that were robust to changes in spatial scale and still provided excellent discrimination and classification accuracy between the ecological groups. These results suggest that continuous spectral signatures acquired in situ at the centimeter scale can be used to select key discrete wavelengths for remote-sensing observations of communities at the meter scale despite the spatial heterogeneity in benthic cover and the resulting spectral mixing.},

abstract = {This study presents an innovative approach to map microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover in Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast) using Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS) hyperspectral data. Microphytobenthos is a microalgae forming a biofilm on the mudflat. Its spatial distribution is heterogeneous so it varies on a finer scale than that of airborne instrument spatial resolution, leading to a "mixed pixel" problem. Moreover, some microphytobenthic species form, at low tide, a biofilm deposited at the surface of the sediment substrate. The resulting signal is a highly non-linear combination of spectral endmembers due to microscale intimate mixtures. This prevents the use of classical linear unmixing models to retrieve biomass from reflectance spectra. A Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) is therefore used to remove the effects of surface roughness, shadowing and any other unknown processes that contribute to the overall shape (continuum) of the reflectance spectra. Then, relationships between microphytobenthos biomass and spectral shapes are derived from a spectral database compiled from laboratory reflectance spectra of microalgal monospecific cultures with different biomasses. Finally, microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover are retrieved from the DAIS image by comparing the reflectance spectra of each pixel to a library of synthetic spectra corresponding to combinations of various biomasses and substrate percent cover. This new approach, when compared to more classically used ones such as indices, linear unmixing or spectral distance analysis, is proven to enable a much more reliable determination of biomass despite the large variety of substrates found in Bourgneuf Bay. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Seagrasses provide a number of critical ecosystem services, including habitat for numerous species, sediment stabilization, and shoreline protection. Ariel photography is a useful tool to estimate the areal extent of seagrasses, but recent innovations in radiometrically calibrated sensors and algorithm development have allowed identification of benthic types and retrieval of absolute density. This study demonstrates the quantitative ability of a high spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral sensor (3.2 nm bandwidth) in the complex coastal waters of Saint Joseph's Bay (SJB). Several benthic types were distinguished, including submerged and floating aquatic vegetation, benthic red algae, bare sand, and optically deep water. A total of 23.6 km2 of benthic vegetation was detected, indicating no dramatic change in vegetation area over the past 30 years. SJB supported high seagrass density at depths shallower than 2 m with an average leaf area index of 2.0 ± 0.6 m2 m−2. Annual seagrass production in the bay was 13,570 t C year−1 and represented 41 % of total marine primary production. The effects of coarser spatial resolution were investigated and found to reduce biomass retrievals, underestimate productivity, and alter patch size statistics. Although data requirements for this approach are considerable, water column optical modeling may reduce the in situ requirements and facilitate the transition of this technique to routine monitoring efforts. The ability to quantify not just areal extent but also productivity of a seagrass meadow in optically complex coastal waters can provide information on the capacity of these environments to support marine food webs.},

abstract = {Many ecological processes in intertidal areas act at very small (mm to cm) spatial scales so manipulative ecological experiments are done at scales at which these processes are proposed to occur. Remote-sensing using field-based sensors enable ecologists to capture variability that must be measured to test hypotheses about small-scale processes. We present two case studies where remote-sensing from field-based platforms has been used to acquire data for manipulative ecological experiments in intertidal areas. The first study, from a rock platform, investigates the spatial scales of variability in chlorophyll (as an index of algal biomass) in experimental plots prior to and after the removal of encrusting macro-algae. Digital colour-infrared (CIR) imagery of the rock platform was obtained before the removal of the encrusting macro-algae and on 1, 44, 75, 117 and 160 days after removal. Amount of chlorophyll was derived from the CIR data using a simple ratio of reflectances at near-infrared (NIR) and red wavelengths. Block Mean Square (BMS) analysis showed that there was little variability in amounts of chlorophyll at very small (≤ 2.26 cm2) scales, prior to and after removal of encrusting macro-algae. The greatest variability occurred at the largest block-size analysed (36.19 cm2). This identifies the spatial scale at which micro-algal food resources are variably scattered on the shore. Results discriminate variability at about 60-80 mm distances. Distributions of micro-algae are caused by a complicated interplay of scale-dependent ecological processes, including grazing. These findings provide a basis for the design of manipulative experiments at appropriate scales to unravel these processes. The second study used field reflectance spectra (350-1050 nm) to: i) determine whether the amount of algae in soft sediments could be changed by manipulating the amounts of light reaching the sediment surface and ii) test the hypothesis that the strength of in vivo absorption features, as indices of the amount of chlorophyll and other pigments, was correlated with measures of sediment-stability (erosion threshold and erosion rate). Several different measures of the strength of absorption features were investigated to determine the best predictor of stability of the sediment. Reflectance spectra showed that amounts of algae had been successfully manipulated. Derivative reflectance at individual wavelengths, indicative of absorption by chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-c, were the best predictors of sediment-stability. These case studies demonstrate some novel uses of field-based remote-sensing to provide information at the spatial scales relevant to many intertidal ecologists. Such techniques should have an increasingly important role in ecological field experimentation where non-destructive sampling of photosynthetic pigments is desired. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The invasion of the wild oyster Crassostrea gigas along the western European Atlantic coast has generated changes in the structure and functioning of intertidal ecosystems. Considered as an invasive species and a trophic competitor of the cultivated conspecific oyster, it is now seen as a resource by oyster farmers following recurrent mass summer mortalities of oyster spat since 2008. Spatial distribution maps of wild oyster reefs are required by local authorities to help define management strategies. In this work, visible-near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing was investigated to map two contrasted intertidal reef structures: clusters of vertical oysters building three-dimensional dense reefs in muddy areas and oysters growing horizontally creating large flat reefs in rocky areas. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with an ASD spectroradiometer, was used to run Spectral Angle Mapper classifications on airborne data obtained with an HySpex sensor (160 spectral bands) and SPOT satellite HRG multispectral data (3 spectral bands). With HySpex spectral/spatial resolution, horizontal oysters in the rocky area were correctly classified but the detection was less efficient for vertical oysters in muddy areas. Poor results were obtained with the multispectral image and from spatially or spectrally degraded HySpex data, it was clear that the spectral resolution was more important than the spatial resolution. In fact, there was a systematic mud deposition on shells of vertical oyster reefs explaining the misclassification of 30% of pixels recognized as mud or microphytobenthos. Spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs were coupled with in situ biomass measurements to illustrate the interest of a remote sensing product to provide stock estimations of wild oyster reefs to be exploited by oyster producers. This work highlights the interest of developing remote sensing techniques for aquaculture applications in coastal areas.},

abstract = {Sabellaria alveolata is a sedentary gregarious tube-building species widely distributed from southwest Scotland to Morocco. This species builds what are currently considered the largest European biogenic reefs in the bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (France). As an ecosystem engineer, S. alveolata generates small to large scale topographic complexity, creating numerous spatial and trophic niches for other species to colonize. Sabellaria reefs are also under anthropogenic pressures, leading locally to massive degradation. However, stakeholders lack spatially explicit measures of reef ecological status, at adapted spatial resolution to provide key management information for this protected habitat. Traditional field surveys are extremely time-consuming and rely on expertise for visual ecological status assessment. The present study aims at using an automatic processing approach based on optical airborne data to (i) assess the potential of hyperspectral imagery to discriminate Sabellaria bioconstructions and its main ecosystem associated habitats, including different types of substrate as well as biological components and (ii) to use the combination of the hyperspectral and LiDAR signals to estimate the spatial structure of the different bioconstruction types (veneers vs. hummocks and platforms) and ecological phases (retrograding and prograding). A reef from Mont-Saint-Michel was used as a test site. We built a processing chain based on supervised classification using the Mahalanobis distance to generate an accurate distribution map (overall accuracy of 88% and a Kappa of 0.85) of 10 Sabellaria-related benthic features, including large reef developing on sand and smaller veneers encrusting rocky shore areas. Specific spectral indices were used to define the spatial distribution of the main primary producers, in particular the microphytobenthos. Joining the hyperspectral and LiDAR data led characterizing the distribution of S. alvealata's ecological status (prograding and retrograding phases) with an overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient that can respectively amount to up to 93 and 0.86. In our study site, the Sabellaria reef area (between 5.52 and 6.76 ha) was dominated by retrograding phases (between 53 and 58%). Our results showed that this automatic processing chain could be relevant for the spatial characterization of other Sabellaria reef sites. Study perspectives tend toward a quantitative estimation of their ecological status index.},

abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) at the sediment surface of intertidal mudflats are known to show a high spatial and temporal variability in response to the biotic and abiotic conditions prevailing at the mud surface. It makes long-term and large-scale monitoring of MPB Gross Primary Production (GPP) difficult to set up. In this study, we developed the first 3D physical-biological coupled model (MARS-3D) that explicitly simulates GPP of intertidal MPB at the mudflat scale, and we compared the outputs with in situ and space remote sensing MPB GPP data. We discuss the sources of discrepancies between the modeling and the remote sensing approach in the light of future developments to be done. For instance, the remote sensing algorithm provides a very synoptic view of the mudflat GPP. It is well-suited to achieve diagnostic estimates of MPB GPP at the synoptic spatial and temporal scale. By contrast, the MARS-3D model provides a more dynamic representation of the MPB activity and prognostic estimates of MPB GPP over the mudflat. It is very relevant to resolve the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of MPB. Getting comparable GPP estimates derived from the remote sensing algorithm and 3D physical-biological coupled model will further require a better convergence in terms of equations structure, biological constants parameterization, and source data used (i.e., vegetation index vs. chlorophyll a). Setting a common parameterization in both the numerical model and remote sensing algorithm might be challenging in a perspective of mapping MPB PP over large mudflats from a synoptic to inter-annual time scale, but it could open the door to a new way of quantifying MPB GPP over large intertidal mudflats.},

abstract = {The gross primary production (GPP) of intertidal mudflat microphytobenthos supports important ecosystem services such as shoreline stabilization and food production, and it contributes to blue carbon. However, monitoring microphytobenthos GPP over a long-term and large spatial scale is rendered difficult by its high temporal and spatial variability. To overcome this issue, we developed an algorithm to map microphytobenthos GPP in which the following are coupled: (i) NDVI maps derived from high spatial resolution satellite images (SPOT6 or Pl{\'{e}}iades), estimating the horizontal distribution of the microphytobenthos biomass; (ii) emersion time, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and mud surface temperature simulated from the physical model MARS-3D; (iii) photophysiological parameters retrieved from Production–irradiance (P–E) curves, obtained under controlled conditions of PAR and temperature, using benthic chambers, and expressing the production rate into mg C h–1 m–2 ndvi–1. The productivity was directly calibrated to NDVI to be consistent with remote-sensing measurements of microphytobenthos biomass and was spatially upscaled using satellite-derived NDVI maps acquired at different seasons. The remotely sensed microphytobenthos GPP reasonably compared with in situ GPP measurements. It was highest in March with a daily production reaching 50.2 mg C m–2 d–1, and lowest in July with a daily production of 22.3 mg C m–2 d–1. Our remote sensing algorithm is a new step in the perspective of mapping microphytobenthos GPP over large mudflats to estimate its actual contribution to ecosystem functions, including blue carbon, from local and global scales.},

abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) provides important ecosystem functions and services, contributing significantly to the total primary production in shallow coastal ecosystems. However, determining the factors that regulate the seasonal changes of MPB and its distribution patterns at larger scales is hindered by the considerable spatial and temporal variability in these environments. Here, we studied the dynamics of intertidal MPB biomass, cover, and net growth rates in a south European tidal flat (Cadiz Bay, Spain) over a four-year period using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Pixels dominated by different benthic communities (MPB, Zostera sp., Caulerpa sp. and green macroalgae) were identified at a 10-m resolution using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithm. MPB dominated the intertidal zone. MPB cover did not show a clear seasonal pattern and was clearly higher in the middle of the intertidal range of sea level. Despite interannual variability, MPB biomass was always higher during winter, coinciding with observations from other low latitude intertidal flats with temperate climate, and in the upper-middle intertidal. Net rates of MPB biomass change, calculated from the differences in MPB NDVI over time, showed maximal net growth rates from autumn to winter and maximum loss rates during spring and summer, although with high variability. Our study demonstrates that RF algorithms allow mapping MPB and other intertidal communities from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery accurately obtaining invaluable information from large areas at very high spatio-temporal resolution. The dissimilarities observed in the patterns of MPB variables over time or sea level, indicate differences in their ecological regulation, still largely unknown both here and in other temperate climate intertidal flats. High resolution remote sensing can aid in their detailed and systematic study producing a more integrated view of these systems and contributing to their science-based management and conservation.},

abstract = {Microphytobenthos (MPB) is composed of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that colonize intertidal sediments within the first millimeters of the photic zone and form biofilms at low tide. In estuaries, this benthic group can represent the main primary producer and deliver several ecosystem services. However, it is not currently used as a bioindicator of water quality, contrary to the widespread use of phytobenthos in freshwater settings. This study assesses the potential of developing MBP metrics to assess water quality in transitional waters using Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. A Random Forest machine learning classification was used to distinguish different types of intertidal vegetation in 26 French estuaries and bays, in particular MPB and green macroalgae (chlorophytes), using multispectral indices. High accuracy was generally achieved for the identification of MPB when compared with field validation data, for both User's and Producer's accuracies, which corresponded to 94% and 84% respectively. Two Earth observation variables were retrieved: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy of MPB biomass, and MPB percent cover integrated over the entire intertidal area of the water body. From a total of 918 S2 images from over a full year, 28% were exploitable due to the combined requirements of cloud-free pixels collected during low tide. With its 10 m spatial resolution, S2 was able to map all estuaries. MPB percent cover showed a stronger gradient between estuaries than MPB NDVI. MPB percent cover was also significantly correlated with green macroalgae percent cover, and a group of estuaries characterized by the highest MPB and green macroalgae coverage corresponded to eutrophic sites impacted by intensive farming activities. A multivariate analysis confirmed that MPB percent cover was indeed related to nutrients. It was also related to sediment type which was one of the main factors underlying differences between estuaries. This work is a first step toward a water quality metric using MPB, and several recommendations are proposed to refine this approach. Sentinel-2 imagery, which is publicly available, presents an interesting compromise to map estuarine microphytobenthos in order to assess the ecological status of transitional waters.},

abstract = {This work is an extension of the MicroPhytoBenthos Optical Model (MPBOM) workflow. The model was based on the observation that the biofilm itself has a negligible inherent reflectance and can be described solely by the ratio between its apparent reflectance (RA) and background reflectance (RB), allowing a straightforward calculation of the absorption coefficient ($\alpha$). This coefficient is directly related to pigment concentrations estimated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). To run the model, assess and extend the use of $\alpha$, the background contribution is a critical step. This work shows that: (i) indices based on reflectance and absorption coefficient spectra derived from the optical model correctly identified the main microphytobenthos (MPB) groups covering a pixel; (ii) contrary to the RA index each new $\alpha$ index was insensitive to biomass variations; (iii) for each MPB group there was a significant linear relation between the biomass estimated by HPLC and $\alpha$ peak at 673 nm; (iv) indices based on $\alpha$ spectra were almost insensitive to mixing constraints at a subpixel level. Knowing the background reflectance contribution of MPB biofilms, $\alpha$ can therefore be used to map MPB algal composition and biomass at any scale from MPB synthetized in laboratory to intertidal mudflat airborne observations.},

abstract = {The use of remote sensing techniques allows monitoring of photosynthesis at the ecosystem level and improves our knowledge of plant primary productivity. The main objective of the current study was to develop a remote sensing based method to measure microphytobenthos (MPB) primary production from intertidal mudflats. This was achieved by coupling hyperspectral radiometry (reflectance, $\rho$ and second derivative, $\delta$$\delta$) and PAM-fluorometry (non-sequential light curves, NSLC) measurements. The latter allowed the estimation of primary production using a light use efficiency parameter (LUE) and electron transport rates (ETR) whereas $\rho$ allowed to estimate pigment composition and optical absorption cross-section (a*). Five MPB species representative of the main growth forms: epipelic (benthic motile), epipsammic (benthic motile and non motile) and tychoplanktonic (temporarily resus-pended in the water column) were submitted to increasing light intensities from dark to 1950 $\mu$mol photons.m-2.s-1. Different fluorescence patterns were observed for the three growth-forms and were linked to their xanthophyll cycle (de-epoxydation state). After spectral reflectance measurements, a* was retrieved using a radiative transfer model and several radiometric indices were tested for their capacity to predict LUE and ETR measured by PAM-fluorometry. Only one radiometric index was not species or growth-form specific, i.e. $\delta$$\delta$496/508. This index was named MPBLUE and could be used to predict LUE and ETR. The applicability of this index was tested with simulated bands of a wide variety of hyperspectral sensors at spectral resolutions between 3 and 15 nm of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM).},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing (RS) is routinely used for the large-scale monitoring of microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass in intertidal mudflats and has greatly improved our knowledge of MPB spatio-temporal variability and its potential drivers. Processes operating on smaller scales however, such as the impact of benthic macrofauna on MPB development, to date remain underinvestigated. In this study, we analysed the influence of wild Crassostrea gigas oyster reefs on MPB biofilm development using multispectral RS. A 30-year time series (1985-2015) combining high-resolution (30m) Landsat and SPOT data was built in order to explore the relationship between C. gigas reefs and MPB spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Emphasis was placed on the analysis of a before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment designed to assess the effect of oyster killing on the surrounding MPB biofilms. Our RS data reveal that the presence of oyster reefs positively affects MPB biofilm development. Analysis of the historical time series first showed the presence of persistent, highly concentrated MPB patches around oyster reefs. This observation was supported by the BACI experiment which showed that killing the oysters (while leaving the physical reef structure, i.e. oyster shells, intact) negatively affected both MPB biofilm biomass and spatial stability around the reef. As such, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of nutrient input as an explanation for the MPB growth-promoting effect of oysters, whereby organic and inorganic matter released through oyster excretion and biodeposition stimulates MPB biomass accumulation. MPB also showed marked seasonal variations in biomass and patch shape, size and degree of aggregation around the oyster reefs. Seasonal variations in biomass, with higher NDVI during spring and autumn, were consistent with those observed on broader scales in other European mudflats. Our study provides the first multi-sensor RS satellite evidence of the promoting and structuring effect of oyster reefs on MPB biofilms.},

abstract = {Quantum yield of photosynthesis (ϕ) expresses the efficiency of phytoplankton carbon fixation given certain amount of absorbed light. This photophysiological parameter is key to obtaining reliable estimates of primary production (PPsat) in the ocean based on remote sensing information. Several works have shown that ϕ changes temporally, vertically, and horizontally in the ocean. One of the primary factors ruling its variability is light intensity and thereby, it can be modeled as a function of Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR). We estimated ϕ utilizing long time-series collected in the North Subtropical Oligotrophic Gyres, at HOT and BATS stations (Pacific and Atlantic oceans, respectively). Subsequently the maximum quantum yield (ϕm) and Kϕ (PAR value at half ϕm) were calculated. Median ϕm values were $\sim$0.040 and 0.063 mol C mol photons-1 at HOT and BATS, respectively, with higher values in winter. Kϕ values were $\sim$8.0 and 10.8 mol photons m-2 d-1 for HOT and BATS, respectively. Seasonal variability in Kϕ showed its peak in summer. Dynamical parameterizations for both regions are indicated by their temporal behaviors, where ϕm is related to temperature at BATS while Kϕ to PAR, in both stations. At HOT, ϕm was weakly related to temperature and its median annual value was used for the whole data series. Differences in the study areas, even though both belong to Subtropical Gyres, reinforced the demand for regional parameterizations in PPsat models. Such parameterizations were finally included in a PPsat model based on phytoplankton absorption (PPsat-aphy-based), where results showed that the PPsat-aphy-based model coupled with dynamical parameterization improved PPsat estimates. Compared with PPsat estimates from the widely used VGPM, a model based on chlorophyll concentration (PPsat-chl-based), PPsat-aphy-based reduced model-measurement differences from $\sim$62.8 to $\sim$8.3% at HOT, along with well-matched seasonal cycle of PP (R2 = 0.76). There is not significant reduction in model-measurement differences between PPsat-chl-based and PPsat-aphy-based PP at BATS though (37.8 vs. 36.4%), but much better agreement in seasonal cycles with PPsat-aphy-based (R2 increased from 0.34 to 0.71). Our results point to improved estimation of PPsat by parameterized quantum yield along with phytoplankton absorption coefficient at the core.},

abstract = {Macroalgae blooms (MABs) are a global natural hazard that are likely to increase in occurrence with climate change and increased agricultural runoff. MABs can cause major issues for indigenous species, fish farms, nuclear power stations, and tourism activities. This project focuses on the impacts of MABs on the operations of a British nuclear power station. However, the outputs and findings are also of relevance to other coastal operators with similar problems. Through the provision of an early-warning detection system for MABs, it should be possible to minimize the damaging effects and possibly avoid them altogether. Current methods based on satellite imagery cannot be used to detect low-density mobile vegetation at various water depths. This work is the first step towards providing a system that can warn a coastal operator 6-8 h prior to a marine ingress event. A fundamental component of such a warning system is the spectral reflectance properties of the problematic macroalgae species. This is necessary to optimize the detection capability for the problematic macroalgae in the marine environment. We measured the reflectance signatures of eight species of macroalgae that we sampled in the vicinity of the power station. Only wavelengths below 900 nm (700 nm for similarity percentage (SIMPER)) were analyzed, building on current methodologies. We then derived 1st derivative spectra of these eight sampled species. A multifaceted univariate and multivariate approach was used to visualize the spectral reflectance, and an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) provided a species-level discrimination rate of 85% for all possible pairwise comparisons. A SIMPER analysis was used to detect wavebands that consistently contributed to the simultaneous discrimination of all eight sampled macroalgae species to both a group level (535-570 nm), and to a species level (570-590 nm). Sampling locations were confirmed using a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), with the collected imagery being used to produce a single orthographic image via standard photogrammetric processes. The waveband found to contribute consistently to group-level discrimination has previously been found to be associated with photosynthetic pigmentation, whereas the species-level discriminatory waveband did not share this association. This suggests that the photosynthetic pigments were not spectrally diverse enough to successfully distinguish all eight species. We suggest that future work should investigate a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)-based sensor using the wavebands highlighted above. This should facilitate the development of a regional-scale early-warning MAB detection system using UAVs, and help inform optimum sensor filter selection.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing from aircraft and satellite sensors is an important tool for mapping shallow benthic habitats in areas where high spectral and spatial resolutions are needed e.g. spatially heterogeneous coastal environments. However, the acquisition of hyperspectral images sometimes involves a high economic investment and there is no prior guarantee of their utility. Physics-based methods like bio-optical models are an alternative to assess sensors without purchasing the images. In this study we used a simple bio-optical model that simulates reflectance spectra for waters with variable depth and benthic macroalgal cover. The modelled spectral library was used to assess the capability of CASI-2 sensor to recognise different benthic macroalgal species. Reflectance spectra of 17 macroalgal species were used in the model simulations. Uni- and multi-variate statistical analyses were used to evaluate the spectral differences between several species. The results show that only a few species seem to be clearly differentiable: Codium tomentosum, Laminaria saccharina and Corallina officinalis. Therefore, further bio-optical modelling was applied at the level of taxonomic groups rather than species level. Emerged green, brown and red macroalgae as well as sand can be differentiated from each other when using the CASI-2 sensor. The bio-optical simulations showed that the three macroalgal groups can be separated from each other in waters shallower than 4. m when CASI-2 is used. Green and brown macroalgae can be differentiated from deep water if the water depth does not exceed 6. m whereas red macroalgae can be optically separated from deep water when the water depth is less than 5. m. Sea-beds covered with the three macroalgal groups are separable from sandy sea-beds in waters shallower than 10 m. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Seagrass meadows are monitored in the frame of several environmental programs worldwide, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD), to evaluate the ecological status of European coastal and transitional water bodies. The large size, spatial complexity, and interannual variability of seagrass ecosystems significantly challenge field monitoring. In this study, a multi-mission satellite time-series was used to estimate long-term changes in seagrass status in a macrotidal system dominated by Zostera noltei, at Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). Metrics of seagrass extent and density were obtained from Earth Observation (EO) using validated and inter-calibrated Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel2 data from 1985 to 2020. The information provided by satellite data made it possible to compute and compare several seagrass indicators currently in use in several European countries (France, Portugal and UK) within the WFD. Both the seagrass extent and meadow-averaged density displayed increasing trends since 1985. A time-series of merged observations from various satellites revealed a high degree of interannual variability in seagrass extent, with abrupt losses (up to 50% within one year) alternating with periods of slow recovery (typically 4–6 years). The seagrass meadow which was in a moderate status (sensu the WFD) in the 1980s, achieved an overall recurrent good or high status since the mid-1990s. Altogether, the methods and results presented here demonstrated that EO is a reliable source of information for mapping and assessing the status of intertidal seagrass, complementing in situ measurements by providing long-term, spatial view and standardized observation framework. We recommend the systematic use of EO time-series in complement to traditional field measurements in seagrass monitoring programs such as the WFD.},

abstract = {The spectral signatures of the seagrasses Zostera capricorni, Posidonia australis, and Halophila ovalis were investigated to determine whether species could be discriminated by remote sensing. The spectral reflectance of fouled and unfouled leaf samples collected from marine and brackish habitats at three estuaries in southeastern Australia were measured in the field with a spectroradiometer during each season in 1999 and 2000. Seagrass species were spectrally distinct regardless of whether the leaves were fouled by epibionts and despite spatial and temporal variability in the reflectance of each species. The visible wavelengths that penetrate water coincide with the regions of maximum absorption and characteristic reflectance by plant photosynthetic and accessory pigments. Strong and consistent differences in reflectance between species were recorded in the green wavelengths at 530-580 nm with additional discrimination in the regions 520-530 nm and 580-600 nm and at the red chlorophyll absorption trough at 686-700 nm. Species discrimination should be possible in the remote sensing of benthic aquatic vegetation using a hyperspectral sensor that has narrow bands centered on pigment-related spectral features in the visible wavelengths. The detection of statistically significant differences in intraspecific reflectance associated with the year, season, estuary, and habitat of sample collection suggests a potential for monitoring seagrass health and estuarine water quality. This study has produced the first spectral library of aquatic plant species to take into account the range of spectral variability expected for the species under natural conditions. The results provide a sound basis for future mapping of seagrass species in Australia.},

Benthic algal communities play an important role in these ecosystems due to their ecological functions and support a great part of this biological richness. We tested by means of bio-optical modelling and Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) images to what extent remote sensing could be used to map these communities in R{\'{i}}a de Vigo and R{\'{i}}a de Ald{\'{a}}n (NW Spain). Reflectance spectra of dominating macroalgae groups were modelled for different water depths in order to estimate the separability of different bottom types based on their spectral signatures and the spectral characteristics of the AHS. Our results indicate that separation between three macroalgae groups (green, brown and red) as well as sand is possible when the bottoms are emerged during low tide. The spectra differences decrease rapidly with increasing water depth. Two types of classifications were carried out with the three AHS images: maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper (SAM). Maximum likelihood showed positive results reaching overall accuracy percentages higher than 95 % and kappa coefficients higher than 0. 90 for the bottom classes: shallow sand, deep sand, emerged rock, emerged macroalgae and submerged macroalgae. Sand and algae substrates were then separately analysed with SAM. These classifications showed positive results for differentiation between green and brown macroalgae until 5 m depth and high differences between all macroalgae and sandy substrate. However, differences between red and brown macroalgae are only detectable when the algae are emerged. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Accurate habitat mapping methods are urgently required for the monitoring, conservation, and management of blue carbon ecosystems and their associated services. This study focuses on exposed intertidal seagrass meadows, which play a major role in the functioning of nearshore ecosystems. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) data, we demonstrate that satellite remote sensing can be used to map seagrass percent cover (SPC) and leaf biomass (SB), and to characterize its seasonal dynamics. In situ radiometric and biological data were acquired from three intertidal meadows of Zostera noltei along the European Atlantic coast in the summers of 2018 and 2019. This information allowed algorithms to estimate SPC and SB from a vegetation index to be developed and assessed. Importantly, a single SPC algorithm could consistently be used to study Z. noltei-dominated meadows at several sites along the European Atlantic coast. To analyze the seagrass seasonal cycle and to select images corresponding to its maximal development, a two-year S2 dataset was acquired for a French study site in Bourgneuf Bay. The potential of S2 to characterize the Z. noltei seasonal cycle was demonstrated for exposed intertidal meadows. The SPC map that best represented seagrass growth annual maximum was validated using in situ measurements, resulting in a root mean square difference of 14%. The SPC and SB maps displayed a patchy distribution, influenced by emersion time, mudflat topology, and seagrass growth pattern. The ability of S2 to measure the surface area of different classes of seagrass cover was investigated, and surface metrics based on seagrass areas with SPC ≥ 50% and SPC ≥ 80% were computed to estimate the interannual variation in the areal extent of the meadow. Due to the high spatial resolution (pixel size of 10 m), frequent revisit time (≤ 5 days), and long-term objective of the S2 mission, S2-derived seagrass time-series are expected to contribute to current coastal ecosystem management, such as the European Water Framework Directive, but to also guide future adaptation plans to face global change in coastal areas. Finally, recommendations for future intertidal seagrass studies are proposed.},

abstract = {The changes in spatial distribution of intertidal Zostera noltii seagrass beds were studied with multispectral visible-infrared remote sensing in Bourgneuf Bay (France) over a 14-year period, between 1991 and 2005. Six SPOT satellite images acquired at low tide were calibrated using in situ spectroradiometric data and processed with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A steady and linear increase in meadow areas was observed between 1991 and 2005 with total surfaces colonized by Z. noltii increasing from 208 to 586 ha, respectively. A greater increase in the densest part of the meadow (NDVI > 0.4) was also observed: it represented only 15% of total meadow surfaces in 1991 vs. 35% in 2005. The seagrass expansion took place mainly towards the lower part of the intertidal zone, while in the upper intertidal zone the meadow appeared strictly limited by the +4 m (Lowest Astronomical Tide) bathymetric level. The influence of Z. noltii above-ground biomass variations on spectral reflectance was analyzed experimentally by spectrometry. Z. noltii displays a characteristic steep slope from 700 to 900 nm, increasing with increasing biomass. A quantitative relationship obtained experimentally between NDVI and the dry weight of leaves was used to produce a biomass distribution map. The distribution of Bourgneuf Bay intertidal seagrass beds is certainly constrained by the water turbidity and we suggest that tidal flat accretion could be a significant variable explaining the observed expansion downwards. With very limited spatial interactions, oyster aquaculture cannot be considered as a threat, while a recent increase in recreational hand fishing of Manila clams within the beds could become problematic. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To test the methodology, organisms from different taxonomical groups and different pigment composition were used (Spirulina platensis a Cyanophyta, Porphyridium cruentum a Rhodophyta, Dunaliella tertiolecta a Chlorophyta and Entomoneis paludosa a Bacillariophyta) and photoacclimated to two different irradiance levels: 25 $\mu$mol photon m -2 s-1 (Low Light, LL) and 500 $\mu$mol photon m -2 s-1 (High Light, HL). Second derivative spectra from reflectance were used to identify pigment in vivo absorption bands that were linked to specific pigments detected by high performance liquid chromatography. Whereas some absorption bands such as those induced by Chlorophyll (Chl) a (416, 440, 625 and around 675 nm) were ubiquous, others were taxonomically specific (e.g. 636 nm for Chl c in E. paludosa) and/or photo-physiological dependent (e.g. 489 nm for zeaxanthin in the HL-acclimated S. platensis). The optical absorption cross-section, a*, was retrieved from reflectance data using a radiative transfer model previously developed for microphytobenthos. Despite the cellular Chl a decrease observed from LL to HL (up to 88% for S. platensis), the a* increased, except for P. cruentum. This was attributed to a 'package effect' and to a greater absorption by photoprotective carotenoids that did not contribute to the energy transfer to the core Chl a. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The influence of phenological variations on the reflectance of the intertidal marine angiosperm Zostera noltii was studied using spectroradiometry and pigment analysis. Leaves were sampled each month from March to November and spectral reflectance was measured in the 400-900nm wavelength range in the laboratory for increasing biomass. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the pigment composition and concentration of the leaves and their epiphytes. Several vegetation indices (VIs) were tested for their sensitivity to seasonal variations, from NDVI-like ratios to indices based on derivative analysis. Pigment concentration showed a seasonal effect, with the highest concentrations observed in summer, synchronous with the above-ground biomass peak. The seasonal variations were clearly visible in the leaf reflectance spectrum, showing for the same amount of vegetation, lower reflectance in summer for the visible wavelengths and a higher near-infrared (NIR) plateau compared to the other months. Indices based on the difference between the red and NIR reflectance values, typically all the NDVI-like ratios, were the most sensitive to seasonal variations in pigment concentration. In fact, seasonal effects were systematically reduced for VIs including a blue band correction, namely the modified Specific Ratio (mSR(705)), the modified Normalized Difference (mND(705)), the modified NDVIs for Landsat, FORMOSAT and narrow band NDVI (mNDVI(673)) as well as the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). However, these indices showed a faster saturation for increasing seagrass biomass, except for the mSR(705), which was the least sensitive to biomass saturation. The interesting properties of this index suggest that it should now be tested for airborne or satellite remote sensing mapping of Z. noltii beds but it requires a high spectral resolution and cannot be applied to multispectral satellite images. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Twenty four fresh water algal species were screened for their antibacterial activity and biomolecules. Bactericidal activity was tested against two gram +ve and four gram -ve bacteria. Maximum antibacterial activity was observed in methanol extracts and least in aqueous extracts. Maximum activity (14mm) was observed in the extracts of Nostoc, Lyngbya, Mougeotia and Pithophora sp. Gram +ve bacteria were more susceptible than gram -ve bacteria. Thirteen algal species are associated with tannins and phenols, 11 species with steroids, 5 species with flavonoids and 8 species with saponins. Maximum chlorophyll-a was recorded with Ulothrix (5.6 mg/g) and least in Tolypothrix (0.5 mg/g). Chlorophyll-b was recorded maximum in Vaucheria (4.2 mg/g) and least in Cylindrospermum (0.6 mg/g). Maximum carotenoid content was recorded in Ulothrix (4.5 mg/g) and least in Tolypothrix and Oscillatoria (0.6 mg/g). Range of protein content was 4-20% with maximum yield in Cylindrospermum sp. (20%) and least in Hydrodictyon (4%). Carbohydrate content ranged from 14-35% with maximum yield in Mougeotia (35%) and least in Tolypothrix (14%). Their pharmacological activities and bioactive molecules can be highly exploited.},

abstract = {Dinophyta, Cryptophyta, Euglenophyta, Haptophyta, Xanthophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, and Raphidophyceae may become important constituents of the algal communities under specific environmental conditions, or when the competition of the other algae lessen. Among these minor groups, the dinoflagellates and the cryptophytes play an active role in the seasonal succession of the phytoplankton community in a large variety of lakes. Most of the common motile dinoflagellates (e.g.,. Ceratium hirundinella) show defined seasonal patterns, being present as benthic stages and with rare or no representatives during the winter months in the temperate zones. In the largest species (e.g.,. Ceratium,. Peridinium), low growth rates, which may represent a negative competitive factor, can be balanced by competitive advantages, which include the ability to perform large vertical movement and resistance to zooplankton grazing. Contrary to many other phytoplankters, which may show a clear seasonality in response to specific factors, cryptomonads are characterized by a permanent presence through the year, with seasonal peaks often following the decline of other previous dominant phytoplankters or periods of water turbulence. In this group, several species are known to grow in eutrophic or moderately productive lakes, developing strong physical and chemical gradients, e.g., near the oxic-anoxic boundary of the water column. The xanthophytes are a morphologically heterogeneous group; they generally develop with the highest diversity in acidic waters enriched with dissolved organic matter. Species belonging to the remaining groups may be widespread (as the haptophyte. Chrysochromulina parva) or fill peculiar niches, blooming in brackish waters (the haptophyte. Prymnesium parvum) or in organic rich environments (the euglenoid. Euglena). Among the Raphidophyceae,. Gonyostomum has recently showed a marked increase in Scandinavia, possibly in relation to freshwater acidification and eutrophication. The eustygmatophytes are a small group of sparse and limited distribution.},

@article{Buchel2020,
abstract = {Besides the so-called ‘green lineage' of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms that include vascular plants, a huge variety of different algal groups exist that also harvest light by means of membrane intrinsic light harvesting proteins (Lhc). The main taxa of these algae are the Cryptophytes, Haptophytes, Dinophytes, Chromeridae and the Heterokonts, the latter including diatoms, brown algae, Xanthophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae amongst others. Despite the similarity in Lhc proteins between vascular plants and these algae, pigmentation is significantly different since no Chl b is bound, but often replaced by Chl c, and a large diversity in carotenoids functioning in light harvesting and/or photoprotection is present. Due to the presence of Chl c in most of the taxa the name ‘Chl c-containing organisms' has become common, however, Chl b-less is more precise since some harbour Lhc proteins that only bind one type of Chl, Chl a. In recent years huge progress has been made about the occurrence and function of Lhc in diatoms, so-called fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins (FCP), where also the first molecular structure became available recently. In addition, especially energy transfer amongst the unusual pigments bound was intensively studied in many of these groups. This review summarises the present knowledge about the molecular structure, the arrangement of the different Lhc in complexes, the excitation energy transfer abilities and the involvement in photoprotection of the different Lhc systems in the so-called Chl c-containing organisms. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Light harvesting, edited by Dr. Roberta Croce.},

@article{Goss2020,
abstract = {The xanthophyll cycles of higher plants and algae represent an important photoprotection mechanism. Two main xanthophyll cycles are known, the violaxanthin cycle of higher plants, green and brown algae and the diadinoxanthin cycle of Bacillariophyceae, Xanthophyceae, Haptophyceae, and Dinophyceae. The forward reaction of the xanthophyll cycles consists of the enzymatic de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin or diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin during periods of high light illumination. It is catalyzed by the enzymes violaxanthin or diadinoxanthin de-epoxidase. During low light or darkness the back reaction of the cycle, which is catalyzed by the enzymes zeaxanthin or diatoxanthin epoxidase, restores the epoxidized xanthophylls by a re-introduction of the epoxy groups. The de-epoxidation reaction takes place in the lipid phase of the thylakoid membrane and thus, depends on the nature, three dimensional structure and function of the thylakoid lipids. As the xanthophyll cycle pigments are usually associated with the photosynthetic light-harvesting proteins, structural re-arrangements of the proteins and changes in the protein-lipid interactions play an additional role for the operation of the xanthophyll cycles. In the present review we give an introduction to the lipid and fatty acid composition of thylakoid membranes of higher plants and algae. We introduce the readers to the reaction sequences, enzymes and function of the different xanthophyll cycles. The main focus of the review lies on the lipid dependence of xanthophyll cycling. We summarize the current knowledge about the role of lipids in the solubilization of xanthophyll cycle pigments. We address the importance of the three-dimensional lipid structures for the enzymatic xanthophyll conversion, with a special focus on non-bilayer lipid phases which are formed by the main thylakoid membrane lipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. We additionally describe how lipids and light-harvesting complexes interact in the thylakoid membrane and how these interactions can affect the structure of the thylakoids. In a dedicated chapter we offer a short overview of current membrane models, including the concept of membrane domains. We then use these concepts to present a model of the operative xanthophyll cycle as a transient thylakoid membrane domain which is formed during high light illumination of plants or algal cells.},

@article{Cartaxana2016,
abstract = {Changes in biomass and photosynthesis of a diatom-dominated microphytobenthos (MPB) intertidal community were studied over a diel emersion period using a combination of O2 and scalar irradiance microprofiling, variable chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence, and pigment analysis. The MPB biomass in the photic zone (0-0.5 mm) of the sediment exposed to low irradiance (150 $\mu$mol photons m-2 s-1) showed a >2-fold increase during the first hours of the emersion period, reaching >0.2 mg Chl a cm-3. Concentrations of Chl a started to decrease half-way through the emersion period, almost 2 h before tidal inundation. Similarly, O2 concentrations and volumetric gross photosynthesis in the photic zone increased during the first half of the emersion period and then decreased toward the timing of incoming tide/darkness. The results suggest that intertidal MPB community-level photosynthesis is mainly controlled by changes in the productive biomass of the photic zone determined by cell migration. A diel pattern in the photosynthesis vs. irradiance parameters a (photosynthetic efficiency at limiting irradiance) and ETRmax (photosynthetic capacity at saturating irradiance) was also observed, suggesting photoacclimation of MPB. Under high light exposure (2000 $\mu$mol photons m-2 s-1), lower $\alpha$, ETRmax and sediment O2 concentrations were observed when cell migration was inhibited with the diatom motility inhibitor latrunculin A (Lat A), showing that migration is also used by MPB to maximize photosynthesis by reducing exposure to potentially photoinhibitory light levels. A higher de-epoxidation state in sediment treated with Lat A indicates that the involvement of the xanthophyll cycle in physiological photoprotection is more relevant in MPB when cells are inhibited from migrating. In the studied diatom-dominated MPB intertidal community, cell migration seems to be the key factor regulating photosynthesis over a diel emersion period and upon changes in light exposure.},

abstract = {Remote sensing is one the most promising approaches to coastal area cartography, including mapping algae forests. After discrimination of algal communities from other benthic habitats, next step is species discrimination (from other algae). Spectral signature provides the most complete remote description to characterize any algae. In this work spectral signatures are studied from the point of view of taxa separability to assess the potential use of remote sensors to map seaweed in coastal waters. Three approaches were tested: Red-Green-Brown colorimetry (sRGB), optimal spectral boundary separation based on True Skill Statistics (TSS-OB), and pigment absorbance band detection by Derivative Spectroscopy (DS). An extensive spectral library of 36 algal species present in the Atlantic Galician coast (NW of Spain) is used to test and validate these methods. The results show that the three broad taxa of red, green and brown algae can be separated by all three methods (Cohen's kappa of 0.697, 0.891 and 0.910, respectively). The TSS-OB and the DS approaches provide almost perfect classification (despite some anomalous specimens), with DS being slightly better. The sRGB approach, useful for in situ photographic classification, also provides good results.},

@article{Clarke1993,
abstract = {Abstract In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi‐species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often‐quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self‐consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically‐relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C'. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non‐parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.
