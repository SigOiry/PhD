This doctoral research successfully addressed its principal objectives, which were to: (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of RS for mapping soft-bottom intertidal vegetation at multispectral resolution, (2) developmachine learning algorithms for accurate vegetation classification and ecosystem monitoring, and (3) Apply the methodology to map invasive species and analyse the effect of heatwaves on seagrass.
This work underscores the potential of RS technologies in addressing ecological challenges in intertidal zones, including the impacts of climate change, anthropogenic pressures, and habitat fragmentation. By demonstrating improved accuracy in habitat classification, from seagrass discrimination to IAS mapping, this work highlights the critical role of multispectral and hyperspectral data obtaining explicit spatial distribution maps of the main classes of intertidal vegetaiton. Integrating ground-based, drone, and satellite observations proved pivotal in bridging spatial and temporal gaps, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and dynamics.
This concluding section reviews the key scientific advancements made through the application of RS to intertidal ecosystems, the challenges encountered, and future research directions.

## Macrophytes discrimination and associated challenges.

This work has demonstrated the capability of multispectral RS when combined with sophisticated machine-learning techniques to differentiate between various types of intertidal vegetation, even among plants with similar pigment compositions. This capability was initially validated theoretically using a hyperspectral library degraded to the spectral resolution of several sensors. It was subsequently confirmed using a multispectral camera mounted on a drone. The distinction was particularly challenging between green macrophytes, such as seagrass and green macroalgae, which share similar pigment compositions and, consequently, spectral signatures. However, slight variations in the spectral signatures of intertidal green macrophytes enable this discrimination to arise from differences in the proportions in which these pigments are present in each vegetation types. 
Pigment concentrations and ratios are not static over time following phenological cycles, are impacted by stress conditions or may not be uniform within a species due to phenotypic variability, limiting the application of the method developed here to certain conditions. The classification method was developed across a wide geographical range, with the initial objective of discriminating among green macrophytes. The Drone Intertidal Substrate Classification of Vegetation (DISCOV) machine-learning algorithm was designed to be dynamic and adaptable, allowing continuous evolution over time. The algorithm open-source, with its complete code and training/validation dataset openly shared on GitHub (https://github.com/SigOiry/ ; @oiry2024discriminating). This flexibility proved invaluable when adapting the algorithm to specifically target a species from a different class of intertidal vegetation: the invasive rhodophyte *Gracilaria vermiculophylla*.

Interestingly, DISCOV v1.0 exhibited poor performance in identifying this red macroalgae, despite its distinct and unique spectral signature attributed to the presence of phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. The algorithm's underperformance was traced to the lack of enough samples of this class in the original training dataset, causing confusion with other classes when encountering this specific spectral signature during prediction. This issue was promptly addressed by updating the model’s training dataset to include more red algae samples. The updated model outperformed the original version on the new dataset while maintaining nearly the same accuracy on the original dataset. Including a more diverse training dataset improved DISCOV’s performance across broader ecological contexts. Expanding the geographic and temporal range of data collection has been shown to enhance algorithm robustness and adaptability. By incorporating spectral data from multiple seasons and regions, the algorithm could better account for temporal variations in pigment concentrations and environmental factors, ensuring more reliable predictions across diverse conditions.

## Drone and Satellite Interactions

UAVs provide high spatial resolution imagery, essential for capturing fine-scale heterogeneity, enabling the observation of subtle spatial patterns within habitats, and validating data derived from lower-resolution satellite imagery. High-resolution multispectral drones, when paired with classifier models, facilitate precise habitat mapping by identifying variations that may not be apparent otherwise. Furthermore, these drones produce large training datasets that are critical for enhancing the accuracy of ML models based on deep-learning architectures in satellite-based RS. Integrating UAV-derived observations and field-specific data, is particularly relevant for  developing machine-learning workflow in complex environments such as intertidal zones.

Satellites, such as Sentinel-2, complement UAVs by offering broad spatial coverage and consistent temporal monitoring, facilitating seasonal and inter-annual changes assessment. This enables systematic analysis of long-term trends and spatial dynamics across expansive geographic areas and quantifying large surfaces. While drones excel in localized, high-resolution observations, satellites provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for monitoring intertidal ecosystems at regional and global scales. This integration ensures that monitoring programs benefit from detailed localized insights while maintaining broader ecological context.

The combination of these technologies allows to leverage their respective strengths. For instance, UAV-acquired habitat data significantly enhance and validate satellite-based classifications, as demonstrated in the ICE CREAMS model [@davies2024intertidal ; @davies2024sentinel], where outputs of DISCOV were used to train and validate seagrass habitat classifications across Europe [@fig-WorkflowBede]. This hybrid methodology balances local accuracy and scalability, reducing the costs associated with large-scale monitoring while preserving the depth of localized observations necessary for comprehensive assessments.

Integrating drone and satellite technologies enhances the ability to monitor, analyse, and manage intertidal ecosystems effectively. By combining detailed precision with extensive coverage, these technologies address scientific and environmental challenges efficiently. They improve modelling accuracy, inform evidence-based conservation strategies, and provide critical tools for adaptive management in the context of environmental change.

For instance, the Intertidal Classification of Europe: Categorising Reflectance of Emerged Areas of Marine vegetation with Sentinel-2 (ICE CREAMS, @davies2024intertidal ; @davies2024sentinel) model has been develop in parallel to DISCOV, using its outputs as categorical input for the training on Sentinel-2 reflectance data. Its usage is comparable to DISCOV but uses Satallite reflectane instead of drone.

This allow for the spatial, and temporal upscaling of the methodology presented in this thesis, allowing to map intertidal vegetation across Europe, since 2017. Developed by @davies2024sentinel, this method has been employed to analyze the phenology of seagrasses across a 23° latitudinal gradient in Europe. Utilizing Sentinel-2 data since 2017, the study has revealed a clear latitudinal pattern in seagrass phenology. In northernmost meadows, seagrasses completely disappear during winter, reaching their maximum extent in late August. In contrast, southernmost meadows exhibit minimal seasonal variation, maintaining relatively stable coverage throughout the year and peaking in extent around early February (@fig-PhenologyBede).

ICE CREAMS has also been used by @davies2024intertidal to show the trend of intertidal seagrasses in Europe over time, with some study site showing stability over time and some others showing instability (@fig-TrendsBede). Some sites, like Bourgneuf Bay and Cádiz Bay, demonstrated consistent increases in seagrass cover over the study period (2017–2023), while others, such as Strangford Lough or Beltringharder Koog remained stable.

<!-- ## Seagrass and Invasive Species Interactions -->

<!-- The interaction between seagrasses following HW events and the rapid growth capacity of *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* presents a complex dynamic shaped by environmental stressors, competition, and ecological resilience. These interactions are crucial for understanding the evolving structure and function of intertidal ecosystems under climate change. -->

<!-- Seagrasses, such as *Zostera noltei*, are integral to coastal ecosystems, offering essential services including sediment stabilization, carbon sequestration, and habitat provision. However, their health and resilience are highly vulnerable to environmental stressors, particularly MHWs and AHWs. These events induce physiological stress that manifests as leaf browning, chlorophyll degradation, and reduced photosynthetic efficiency. Observations reveal extensive browning and decreased seagrass coverage in intertidal zones subjected to prolonged high temperatures. The reduction in seagrass cover weakens its competitive edge, particularly in areas where other stressors, such as eutrophication or sediment disruption, are present. -->

<!-- IAS such as *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* exploit ecological disturbances to establish dominance. This red macroalga exhibits remarkable adaptability to varied environmental conditions, including fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. Post-heatwave environments might provide ideal conditions for *G. vermiculophylla* or other IAS to expand. The degradation of seagrass meadows leads to increased light availability and free space making them more susceptible to biological invasions. Dense mats of *G. vermiculophylla* form on soft-bottom sediments, where they can rapidly proliferate and monopolize space and resources. These mats can physically and chemically inhibit the recovery of seagrasses by reducing light penetration and altering sediment composition. -->

<!-- The competitive interplay between seagrasses and *G. vermiculophylla* is exacerbated in the aftermath of HW Seagrasses’ physiological stress limits their ability to recover quickly, creating a temporal window for *G. vermiculophylla* to expand. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors such as nutrient enrichment from agricultural runoff amplify this dynamic by promoting algal growth and suppressing seagrass resilience. The ecological consequences of *G. vermiculophylla* proliferation are multifaceted. While the algae can provide habitat and stabilize sediments, its dominance often disrupts existing trophic interactions and reduces biodiversity. Areas previously dominated by seagrasses may experience shifts in community composition, favouring species adapted to algal habitats. Additionally, the physical characteristics of dense algal mats can alter sediment dynamics and hydrology, further entrenching *G. vermiculophylla*’s presence. -->

<!-- Addressing the interaction between heatwave-stressed seagrasses habitats and IAS such as *G. vermiculophylla* requires integrated monitoring and management approaches. RS technologies, including multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, provide powerful tools for tracking changes in vegetation health and distribution. Monitoring metrics such as the SHSI developed in Chapter 5 enable early detection of thermal stress, allowing for timely interventions. Management strategies should focus on mitigating stressors that exacerbate competitive dynamics. Reducing nutrient inputs to coastal waters can limit the proliferation of *G. vermiculophylla* and other opportunistic species. Physical removal of algal mats, combined with restoration efforts to enhance seagrass resilience, can help reestablish ecological balance. Additionally, incorporating predictive models to assess the impacts of future HW scenarios can guide proactive conservation measures. -->

<!-- The possible interactions between seagrasses and IAS after extreme events might imply the complex interplay of environmental stressors, competition, and ecosystem resilience. Understanding these dynamics might be critical for preserving the ecological integrity of intertidal zones. By leveraging advanced monitoring techniques and implementing targeted management interventions, it is possible to mitigate the adverse effects of IAS and climate-induced stress, thereby supporting the long-term sustainability of these vital coastal ecosystems. -->

## Assessing Coastal Ecosystem Threats Through Remote Sensing

Chapters 4 and 5 illustrate how remote sensing can be utilized to assess threats to coastal ecosystems, addressing both biotic pressures, such as the mapping of the alien invasive *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* (Chapter 4), and abiotic pressures, such as the impact of heatwaves on seagrass meadows (Chapter 5).

Remote sensing technologies have revolutionized the way we assess pressures on coastal ecosystems, offering tools to monitor changes across spatial and temporal scales. Coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and intertidal habitats, face diverse threats such as climate-induced stress, eutrophication, and habitat fragmentation. While traditional field surveys provide valuable insights, they are often time-consuming and limited in scope. Remote sensing complements these methods by enabling consistent, high-resolution monitoring over large areas. Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, in particular, allow for detailed analysis of vegetation health, species composition, and stress indicators (see Chapter 4 & 5, Muller-Karger et al. 2018; Murray et al. 2015). Furthermore, technologies such as LiDAR and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enhance the precision of topographic and hydrological assessments, which are crucial for understanding elevation changes and storm surge dynamics.

Monitoring coastal threats through remote sensing relies on satellite-based platforms such as Sentinel-2, Landsat, and MODIS. These platforms provide data to evaluate changes in vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, SHSI) and other parameters critical to ecological health. These indices play a key role in detecting early signs of ecosystem degradation, such as seagrass browning or the proliferation of invasive species [@murray2018role ; @murray2015tidal]. Additionally, airborne sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance spatial resolution, enabling the mapping of finer-scale features such as algal blooms or sediment displacement caused by coastal erosion or invasive species [@novais2023use]. Advanced machine learning models applied to remote sensing data are increasingly used to detect and predict these phenomena, leveraging large datasets to improve the accuracy of coastal hazard forecasts.

Remote sensing also plays a significant role in structured ecosystem risk assessments by integrating spatial and temporal data into predictive models. For instance, the DAPSI(W)R(M) framework uses remote sensing data to analyze drivers, pressures, and state changes, supporting holistic management of marine and coastal environments [@Mahrad2020 ; @murray2018role]. By employing long-term datasets, remote sensing technologies help identify trends in habitat loss or recovery, providing essential tools for researchers and policymakers to address environmental challenges and implement sustainable management strategies [@Muller-Karger2018 ; @murray2018role]. This includes mapping flood risks, assessing the impacts of sea-level rise, and identifying vulnerable zones, thereby aiding disaster preparedness and adaptive planning.

Through its applications in environmental monitoring and modeling, remote sensing provides a comprehensive understanding of coastal ecosystem dynamics. Its dual ability to offer large-scale overviews and detailed local assessments makes it an indispensable resource for managing and mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic and natural stressors on fragile coastal zones. As cloud-computing platforms and integrated GIS technologies evolve, they further expand the capabilities of remote sensing for real-time and collaborative environmental monitoring.

## Perspectives

Seagrass meadows are experiencing widespread global declines. They are increasingly threatened by human activities such as coastal development and declining water quality. While some areas show signs of stabilization or recovery, losses continue to outpace gains globally. The variability in seagrass trends highlights the urgent need to focus on restoration efforts alongside understanding the drivers of change, as improved restoration strategies are essential for reversing declines and supporting long-term conservation. Seagrass restoration refers to the active and strategic process of reestablishing seagrass meadows in areas where they have been degraded or lost, aiming to reverse habitat loss and enhance ecosystem resilience. These efforts involve transplanting seagrass shoots, enhancing natural recovery processes, and improving environmental conditions to support seagrass growth.

For instance, in Arcachon Bay, France, seagrass meadows, primarily Zostera noltei, historically covered approximately 40 km² of the bay, making it one of the largest seagrass habitats in Europe [@cognat2018environmental]. These meadows experienced a drastic decline, losing over 40% of their coverage between 1989 and 2019 [@muller2024site]. Recognizing this loss, the Natural Marine Park of Arcachon Bay launched active restoration efforts, including the transplantation of Zostera noltei sods and participatory seed collection initiatives. @laurent2024intertidal have shown that after the first monitoring, 85% of the transplanted sods (405 out of 476) had survived, with all 9 sods surviving in 68% of the sites (36 stations), showing a promising start. However, on the two flats monitored twice, a high mortality rate of around 60% was recorded during the second monitoring. Additionally, 82% of transplants expanded at the first monitoring, but only 10% maintained this expansion in the second monitoring, reflecting the complexity of long-term restoration success. This case study highlights the challenges faced by seagrass restoration efforts.

RS can play a critical role in identifying suitable areas for seagrass restoration by mapping habitat suitability and assessing anthropogenic pressures [@hu2021mapping]. By integrating spatial data with environmental predictors such as water quality, depth, and substrate type, it becomes possible to pinpoint locations that offer the greatest potential for successful restoration while minimizing risks from human activities. This technology supports the evaluation of restoration success and facilitates adaptive management by identifying environmental conditions that favor seagrass recovery. By integrating remote sensing with ecological studies, restoration efforts can be more targeted, efficient, and adaptive to ongoing environmental changes. 

RS offers precise tools for monitoring and enhancing seagrass restoration by providing high-resolution spatial data to assess transplanted meadows and detect changes in coverage and health [@ventura2022seagrass]. This technology supports the evaluation of restoration success and facilitates adaptive management by identifying environmental conditions that favor seagrass recovery. By integrating remote sensing with ecological studies, restoration efforts can be more targeted, efficient, and adaptive to ongoing environmental changes.

The DISCOV model represents a significant advancement in applying remote sensing technologies to coastal habitat management. With its ability to classify vegetation at very high spatial resolutions and its demonstrated accuracy in distinguishing seagrass from other macrophytes, the DISCOV model could supports seagrass restoration efforts. By offering precise habitat classification and mapping, DISCOV can aid in identifying optimal restoration sites (finding sites that limit competition with other species) and by monitoring restored meadows. Its application could enhance our capacity to adapt restoration strategies based on real-time, fine-scale data, ultimately supporting the resilience and recovery of seagrass ecosystems.
