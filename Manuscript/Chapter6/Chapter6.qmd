This doctoral research successfully addressed its principal objectives, which were to: (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of remote sensing for mapping intertidal habitats, (2) develop advanced methodologies for accurate vegetation classification and ecosystem monitoring, and (3) to investigate the capacity of remote sensing to mmap ecosystem under biotic and abiotic pressures. 
This work underscore the potential of remote sensing technologies in addressing ecological challenges in intertidal zones, including the impacts of climate change, anthropogenic pressures, and habitat fragmentation. By demonstrating improved accuracy in habitat classification, from seagrass discrimination to invasive species mapping, this work highlights the critical role of multispectral and hyperspectral data in supporting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience. The integration of ground-based, drone, and satellite observations proved pivotal in bridging spatial and temporal gaps, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem dynamics.
This concluding section reviews the key scientific advancements made through the application of remote sensing to intertidal ecosystems, the challenges encountered, and future research directions.

## Macrophytes discriminations and associated challenges.

This work has demonstrated the capability of multispectral remote sensing when combined with sophisticated machine-learning techniques to differentiate between various types of intertidal vegetation, even among plants with similar pigment compositions. This capability was initially validated theoretically using a hyperspectral library degraded to the spectral resolution of several sensors. It was subsequently confirmed using a multispectral camera mounted on a drone. The distinction was particularly challenging between green macrophytes, such as seagrass and green macroalgae, which share similar pigment compositions and, consequently, spectral signatures. However, the slight variations in the spectral signatures of intertidal green macrophytes enabling this discrimination arise from differences in the proportions in which these pigments are present in each type of vegetation. 
Pigment concentrations are not static over time following phenological cycles and impacted by stress conditions or may not be uniform within a species due to phenotypic variability, limiting the application of the method developed here to certain conditions. Despite this limitation, a key strength of the method lies in its development across a wide geographical range, open-source and use-case-driven design. The Drone Intertidal Sediment Classification of Vegetation (DISCOV) algorithm was developed to be dynamic and adaptable over time. The algorithm has been detailed in a scientific journal, with its complete code and training/validation dataset shared openly on GitHub [@oiry2024discriminating]. This flexibility proved invaluable when applying the algorithm to a different use case: mapping the invasive Gracilaria vermiculophylla.

Interestingly, DISCOV v1.0 exhibited poor performance in identifying this red algae, despite its distinct and unique spectral signature attributed to the presence of phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. The algorithm's underperformance was traced to the lack of enough samples of this class in the original training, causing confusion with other classes when encountering this specific spectral signature during prediction. This issue was promptly addressed by updating the model’s training dataset to include more red algae samples. The updated model outperformed the original version on the new dataset while maintaining nearly the same accuracy on the original dataset. Including a more diverse training dataset improved DISCOV’s performance across broader ecological contexts. Expanding the geographic and temporal range of data collection has been shown to enhance algorithm robustness and adaptability. By incorporating spectral data from multiple seasons and regions, the algorithm could better account for temporal variations in pigment concentrations and environmental factors, ensuring more reliable predictions across diverse conditions.

## Drone and Satellite Interactions

UAVs provide high spatial resolution imagery, which is essential for capturing fine-scale heterogeneity, enabling the observation of subtle spatial patterns within habitats, and validating data derived from lower-resolution satellite imagery. High-resolution multispectral drones, when paired with classifier models, facilitate precise habitat mapping by identifying variations that may not be apparent otherwise. Furthermore, these drones produce large training datasets that are critical for enhancing the accuracy of machine learning models based on deep-learning architectures in satellite-based remote sensing. By integrating UAV-derived observations with field-specific data, detailed assessments can be achieved, which are particularly relevant for complex environments such as intertidal zones.

Satellites, such as Sentinel-2, complement UAVs by offering broad spatial coverage and consistent temporal monitoring, facilitating the assessment of seasonal and inter-annual changes. This enables systematic analysis of long-term trends and spatial dynamics across expansive geographic areas and quantifying large surfaces. While drones excel in localized, high-resolution observations, satellites provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for monitoring intertidal ecosystems at regional and global scales. This integration ensures that monitoring programs benefit from detailed localized insights while maintaining broader ecological context.

The combination of these technologies allows to leverage their respective strengths. For instance, UAV-acquired habitat data significantly enhance and validate satellite-based classifications, as demonstrated in the ICE CREAMS model [@davies2024intertidal ; @davies2024sentinel], where UAV data were used to train and validate seagrass habitat classifications across Europe [@fig-WorkflowBede]. This hybrid methodology achieves a balance between local accuracy and scalability, reducing the costs associated with large-scale monitoring while preserving the depth of localized observations necessary for comprehensive assessments.

This integration of drone and satellite technologies enhances the ability to monitor, analyze, and manage intertidal ecosystems effectively. By combining detailed precision with extensive coverage, these technologies address scientific and environmental challenges efficiently. They improve modeling accuracy, inform evidence-based conservation strategies, and provide critical tools for adaptive management in the context of environmental change.

## Seagrass and Invasive species interactions

The interaction between seagrasses following heatwave events and the rapid growth capacity of *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* presents a complex dynamic shaped by environmental stressors, competition, and ecological resilience. These interactions are crucial for understanding the evolving structure and function of intertidal ecosystems under climate change.

Seagrasses, such as *Zostera noltei*, are integral to coastal ecosystems, offering essential services including sediment stabilization, carbon sequestration, and habitat provision. However, their health and resilience are highly vulnerable to environmental stressors, particularly marine and atmospheric heatwaves. These events induce physiological stress that manifests as leaf browning, chlorophyll degradation, and reduced photosynthetic efficiency. Observations reveal extensive browning and decreased seagrass coverage in intertidal zones subjected to prolonged high temperatures. The reduction in seagrass cover weakens its competitive edge, particularly in areas where other stressors, such as eutrophication or sediment disruption, are present.

Invasive species such as *Gracilaria vermiculophylla* exploit ecological disturbances to establish dominance. This red macroalga exhibits remarkable adaptability to varied environmental conditions, including fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. Post-heatwave environments might provide ideal conditions for *G. vermiculophylla*. The degradation of seagrass meadows leads to increased light availability and free space making them more susceptible to biological invasions. Dense mats of *G. vermiculophylla* form on soft-bottom sediments, where they can rapidly proliferate and monopolize space and resources. These mats can physically and chemically inhibit the recovery of seagrasses by reducing light penetration and altering sediment composition.

The competitive interplay between seagrasses and *G. vermiculophylla* is exacerbated in the aftermath of heatwaves. Seagrasses’ physiological stress limits their ability to recover quickly, creating a temporal window for *G. vermiculophylla* to expand. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors such as nutrient enrichment from agricultural runoff amplify this dynamic by promoting algal growth and suppressing seagrass resilience. The ecological consequences of *G. vermiculophylla* proliferation are multifaceted. While the alga can provide habitat and stabilize sediments, its dominance often disrupts existing trophic interactions and reduces biodiversity. Areas previously dominated by seagrasses may experience shifts in community composition, favoring species adapted to algal habitats. Additionally, the physical characteristics of dense algal mats can alter sediment dynamics and hydrology, further entrenching *G. vermiculophylla*’s presence.

Addressing the interaction between heatwave-stressed seagrasses habitats and invasive species such as *G. vermiculophylla* requires integrated monitoring and management approaches. Remote sensing technologies, including multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, provide powerful tools for tracking changes in vegetation health and distribution. Monitoring metrics such as the SHSI developed in Chapter 5 (@eq-SDI) enable early detection of thermal stress, allowing for timely interventions. Management strategies should focus on mitigating stressors that exacerbate competitive dynamics. Reducing nutrient inputs to coastal waters can limit the proliferation of *G. vermiculophylla* and other opportunistic species. Physical removal of algal mats, combined with restoration efforts to enhance seagrass resilience, can help reestablish ecological balance. Additionally, incorporating predictive models to assess the impacts of future heatwave scenarios can guide proactive conservation measures.

The possible interactions between seagrasses and invasive species after extrem events might imply the complex interplay of environmental stressors, competition, and ecosystem resilience. Understanding these dynamics might be critical for preserving the ecological integrity of intertidal zones. By leveraging advanced monitoring techniques and implementing targeted management interventions, it is possible to mitigate the adverse effects of invasive species and climate-induced stress, thereby supporting the long-term sustainability of these vital coastal ecosystems.
