<p>Marine coastal zones are among the most densely populated regions globally, serving as critical hubs for economic activity, transportation, and tourism. These areas support diverse ecosystems and provide essential resources. Additionally, they play a pivotal role in global trade and commerce while also offering cultural and recreational value. However, their popularity and utility make them highly vulnerable to environmental pressures such as pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change impacts like sea-level rise and coastal erosion <span class="citation" data-cites="orth2006global">Valle et al. (<a href="../References/references.html#ref-valle2013comparing" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. Effective management and sustainable practices are crucial to preserving their ecological integrity and ensuring long-term viability.</p>
<p>Marine vegetative habitats in intertidal zones, such as seagrass meadows, microphytobenthos, and macroalgal habitats, face significant hazards from both anthropogenic activities and natural forces. Human-induced threats include coastal development, pollution, overfishing, and habitat modification, chich degrade these ecosystems. Seagrass meadows are threatened by various anthropogenic activities <span class="citation" data-cites="mckenzie2020global">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-mckenzie2020global" role="doc-biblioref">McKenzie et al., 2020</a>)</span>, microphytobenthos are affected by the global decline of intertidal mudflats <span class="citation" data-cites="murray2019global">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-murray2019global" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2019</a>)</span>, and areas colonized by macroalgae may shrink due to the expansion of wild oyster reefs <span class="citation" data-cites="le2016hyperspectral">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-le2016hyperspectral" role="doc-biblioref">Le Bris et al., 2016</a>)</span>. Additionally, natural factors such as storms, sea-level rise, climatic extreme events and climate change exacerbate these pressures, altering the structure, function, and resilience of intertidal habitats.</p>
<p>These habitats provide vital ecological functions, including coastal erosion protection through root stabilization and sediment trapping <span class="citation" data-cites="bos2007ecosystem">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-bos2007ecosystem" role="doc-biblioref">Bos et al., 2007</a>)</span> , mitigation of eutrophication effects by absorbing excess nutrients and improving water quality (<strong>refs</strong>), atmospheric CO2 fixation, contributing to carbon sequestration and combating climate change <span class="citation" data-cites="mcroy1977production">Saderne et al.

(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-sanabria2024unveiling" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>. Despite their ecological significance and ecosystem services they provide, intertidal habitats, particularly mudflats, remain highly vulnerable yet often overlooked. Tidal flats are challenging to access, and traditional field sampling methods are too time- and labor-intensive for repeated observations over large areas. Moreover, large variations across different temporal scales in these habitats require frequent monitoring, which is impractical through field surveys alone. This underscores the need for advanced monitoring technologies, effective management practices and targeted conservation strategies to ensure their sustainability and resilience against diverse and evolving pressures.</p>
<section id="ecological-and-socio-economic-importance-of-coastal-environments" class="level3" data-number="1.1.1">
<h3 data-number="1.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ecological-and-socio-economic-importance-of-coastal-environments"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Ecological and Socio-Economic importance of Coastal Environments</h3>
<p>Coastal environments represent a complex and dynamic interface between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, characterized by exceptional biodiversity, diverse geomorphological structures, and significant socio-economic relevance. These regions span a continuum that includes saltmarshes, beaches, dunes, estuaries, deltas, tidal flats, wetlands, rocky shores, biogenic reefs and lagoons, each shaped by a combination of natural processes and anthropogenic influences <span class="citation" data-cites="laignel2023observation">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-laignel2023observation" role="doc-biblioref">Laignel et al., 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The coastal zone encompasses areas where terrestrial and marine domains intersect, including environments influenced by tidal flows, wave dynamics, and riverine inputs. This transition zone can extend from a few hundred meters inland to several kilometers offshore, depending on local topography and ecological gradients. It incorporates upper shores and dunes, intertidal zones, periodically submerged and exposed to tidal activity, as well as subtidal zones that remain submerged permanently (<a href="#fig-CoastalHabitat" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.1</span></a> ; <span class="citation" data-cites="laignel2023observation">Laignel et al. (<a href="../References/references.html#ref-laignel2023observation" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>As one of the most dynamic and multifaceted regions on Earth, coastal environments host highly diverse and productive habitats. These include both natural ecosystems and managed systems that underpin key economic sectors and urban centers. The functionality of many coastal ecosystems is intrinsically linked to land-sea interactions, as observed in deltas and estuaries. These environments exhibit steep gradients in salinity—from freshwater to hypersaline—and energy levels, ranging from low-energy wetlands to high-energy, wave-dominated shorelines. On a broader scale, coastal regions encompass a spectrum of climatic zones, from tropical to polar, each characterized by unique biogeophysical processes and features. However, these areas are also exposed to a variety of land-based and marine hazards, including storms, tropical cyclones, storm surges, tsunamis, riverine flooding, shoreline erosion, sea-level rise and biohazards such as algal blooms and pollutants.</p>

<p>Coastal ecosystems provide a range of ecosystem services that are fundamental to environmental sustainability and human well-being. These ecosystems function as natural barriers against storm surges and coastal flooding, thereby mitigating the impacts of such hazards on inland regions and safeguarding human lives and infrastructure. They support significant biodiversity, serving as critical habitats and breeding grounds for numerous species, including commercially valuable fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms that sustain global fisheries. Coastal vegetation, including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration by capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus contributing to climate change mitigation.</p>
<p>Beyond their role in climate regulation, well-functioning coastal ecosystems enhance water quality by filtering pollutants, sediments, and excess nutrients, thereby maintaining healthier marine and estuarine systems. These ecosystems are integral to nutrient cycling, ensuring the continued productivity of adjacent marine environments. Additionally, they provide substantial cultural, educational, and recreational opportunities, drawing global attention and fostering an intrinsic human connection to nature. This societal value contributes directly to local and regional economies through industries such as tourism, artisanal fishing, and related enterprises. Furthermore, coastal ecosystems supply essential natural resources, including seafood and plant-based materials, while supporting sustainable aquaculture practices that promote global food security and bolster local livelihoods. Collectively, these functions highlight the indispensable ecological and economic importance of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="human-activities-in-coastal-areas-and-their-environmental-impacts"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Human Activities in Coastal Areas and their Environmental Impacts</h3>
<p>Coastal areas are among the most significant regions for human habitation due to their strategic geographic position, resource availability, and economic opportunities. Currently, approximately 2 billion people reside within 50 kilometers of coastlines, with nearly 1 billion living within 10 kilometers. This represents nearly 15% of the global population occupying only 4% of the Earth’s inhabitable landmass. Projections indicate that coastal populations will continue to rise, potentially reaching 2.9 billion by 2100 under various socioeconomic scenarios. These areas offer critical resources such as seafood and freshwater, while their moderate climates often support agricultural activities and other forms of sustainable land use. Proximity to oceans and rivers enables robust trade, transportation, and industrial growth, positioning many coastal cities as pivotal economic hubs on a global scale. The ecological and cultural roles of coastal landscapes further contribute to their appeal, attracting populations for both settlement and economic activities.</p>
<p>Human utilization of coastal areas spans a range of economic and social activities that highlight both the benefits and challenges of these environments. <a href="https://blue-economy-observatory.ec.europa.eu/eu-blue-economy-sectors/coastal-tourism_en">Coastal tourism</a> is a significant driver of economic growth, particularly in regions like the European Union (EU). In 2021, the EU’s coastal tourism sector generated approximately €49.9 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) and employed around 1.9 million people. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/aquafarming-becomes-main-global-source-fish-un-food-agency-says-2024-06-07">Coastal fishing</a> and aquaculture are vital components of the global economy, providing employment to millions and contributing significantly to food security. In 2022, the combined global production of fisheries and aquaculture reached a record 223.2 million tons, with aquaculture alone producing an unprecedented 130.9 million tons. Notably, for the first time, aquaculture surpassed wild capture in aquatic animal production, accounting for 51% of the total. Additionally, <a href="https://maritime-union.org/how-much-trade-is-maritime/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">maritime shipping</a> is the backbone of international trade, with approximately 80% of global trade by volume and over 70% by value transported via sea routes. This extensive reliance on maritime transport underscores the critical importance of coastal infrastructure, including ports and harbors, in facilitating the movement of goods worldwide. However, the intensive exploitation of coastal environments for human activities has led to significant ecological challenges.</p>
<p>For instance, marine shipping contributes about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure projected to rise by up to 50% by mid-century if stringent measures are not implemented <span class="citation" data-cites="IMO2020GHG">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-IMO2020GHG" role="doc-biblioref">Jasper Faber, 2021</a>)</span>. Additionally, shipping activities lead to marine pollution, including oil spills, ballast water discharge and underwater noise and light affecting marine life. Oil spills remain a critical environmental concern due to their devastating and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems. These spills contaminate water, harm marine biodiversity, and disrupt food chains, often leading to severe economic losses in fisheries and tourism. In 2023, ten oil spills were recorded globally, releasing over 2,000 tons of oil into the environment, including one major spill exceeding 700 tons in Asia <span class="citation" data-cites="itopf_statistics">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-itopf_statistics" role="doc-biblioref">ITOPF, 2023</a>)</span>. While historical trends show a reduction in large spills, from over 20 per year in the 1970s to about 1.3 per year in recent decades, incidents such as the spill occurred in December 2024 in the Kerch Strait, where 3,700 tons of oil were released, underscore the persistent and significant risks. Such events highlight the necessity for stringent preventive measures and rapid response mechanisms to mitigate the ongoing threat posed by oil spills to marine environments. Ballast water discharge represents a significant vector for the introduction of invasive aquatic species into new environments. Approximately 40% of introductions of non-indigenous aquatic species have been linked to ballast water release. Underwater noise pollution from shipping activities poses a growing threat to marine life, particularly cetaceans such as whales and dolphins. Elevated noise levels can disrupt communication, navigation, and feeding behaviors, leading to increased stress and altered migration patterns. Chronic exposure to underwater noise can also result in physical harm and population-level impacts. One significant impact of fishing and aquaculture on coastal habitats is the degradation of critical ecosystems such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves. Destructive fishing practices, including bottom trawling and the use of dynamite or cyanide, physically damage the seafloor and associated habitats, resulting in biodiversity loss and the disruption of ecological functions. The expansion of aquaculture operations often involves converting coastal wetlands, into fish or shrimp ponds, or constructing structures over mudflats. These activities usually conflict with ecosystem conservation, as both uses compete for limited space. Change of land-use into aquaculture facilities reduces the availability of essential nursery habitats for marine species and diminishes the ecosystem services provided by these natural habitats, such as carbon sequestration, shoreline stabilization, and water filtration. Additionally, aquaculture activities contribute to nutrient enrichment and pollution in adjacent waters through the release of uneaten feed, feces, and chemical additives, exacerbating eutrophication and altering benthic community structures. Another significant concern is the introduction of alien invasive species into the environment through aquaculture, which can disrupt local ecosystems and biodiversity. This issue was explored in Chapter 4. Coastal tourism exerts a profound influence on ecosystem integrity, often driving substantial environmental degradation through mechanisms such as habitat destruction, pollution, and resource overexploitation. The construction and expansion of tourist infrastructure frequently lead to the removal or fragmentation of critical habitats, including mangroves, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs, all of which play pivotal roles in maintaining biodiversity and safeguarding coastal resilience. Furthermore, the rapid influx of visitors generates significant volumes of waste and untreated sewage, contributing to water quality deterioration and eutrophication, which disrupt aquatic ecosystems and alter trophic dynamics. The elevated demand for limited resources, notably freshwater and seafood, exacerbates ecological stress, leading to overharvesting and resource depletion.</p>
<p>The dynamic interactions between terrestrial and marine systems are particularly evident in intertidal habitats, which exemplify the transitional nature of coastal zones. The next section will focus on these habitats, exploring their ecological significance, the processes shaping them, and the challenges they face under increasing environmental and anthropogenic pressures.</p>

<p>The intertidal zone refers to the coastal area between the high and low tide marks, characterized by periodic exposure and submersion due to tidal cycles. This dynamic zone forms the interface between terrestrial and marine ecosystems and is influenced by complex physical, chemical, and biological processes.</p>
<p>Tidal flats, a specific type of intertidal habitat, are defined as expanses of sand, rock, or mud that experience regular tidal inundation. These ecosystems are shaped by sediment deposition driven by tidal currents, wave action, and terrestrial runoff. As transitional ecosystems between terrestrial and marine environments, tidal flats face pressures from both domains. Additionally, they encounter unique threats, including coastal development <span class="citation" data-cites="hassan2005ecosystems arkema2013coastal">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-arkema2013coastal" role="doc-biblioref">Arkema et al., 2013</a>; <a href="../References/references.html#ref-hassan2005ecosystems" role="doc-biblioref">Hassan et al., 2005</a>)</span>, rising sea levels <span class="citation" data-cites="passeri2015dynamic lovelock2017mangrove">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-lovelock2017mangrove" role="doc-biblioref">Lovelock et al., 2017</a>; <a href="../References/references.html#ref-passeri2015dynamic" role="doc-biblioref">Passeri et al., 2015</a>)</span>, coastal erosion <span class="citation" data-cites="Nicholls2007">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-Nicholls2007" role="doc-biblioref">Nicholls et al., 2007</a>)</span>, decreased sediment input from rivers <span class="citation" data-cites="blum2009drowning">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-blum2009drowning" role="doc-biblioref">Blum and Roberts, 2009</a>)</span>, and the subsidence and compaction of coastal sediments <span class="citation" data-cites="minderhoud2020groundwater">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-minderhoud2020groundwater" role="doc-biblioref">Minderhoud et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Regions such as East Asia, the Middle East, and North America have shown the greatest losses. These declines mirror trends observed in other coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses. Despite these losses, some areas have exhibited resilience or even expansion, highlighting the dynamic interplay between sedimentary processes, sea-level rise, and human interventions <span class="citation" data-cites="murray2019global">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-murray2019global" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A potential solution to limit the disappearance of tidal flats is to protect the ecosystems they host. These ecosystems contribute significantly to nutrient cycling and sediment stabilization, enhancing the overall resilience of tidal flats. By maintaining these biotic communities, the ecological functions of tidal flats can be preserved, buffering them against threats such as erosion and rising sea levels.</p>
<p>The main vegetation classes found on tidal flats will be introduced in the following sections, as Chapters 2 and 3 rely specifically on distinguishing between these classes. Here, “classes” is considered in its taxonomic sense, referring to a toaxonomic rank that groups related orders of organisms sharing a common ancestor.</p>

Additionally, at high tide, tidal currents and waves can resuspend the MPB, making it available in the water column for suspension feeders and facilitating the export of a portion of its biomass to adjacent ecosystems <span class="citation" data-cites="de1995wind decottignies2007exploitation">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-de1995wind" role="doc-biblioref">De Jorge and Van Beusekom, 1995</a>; <a href="../References/references.html#ref-decottignies2007exploitation" role="doc-biblioref">Decottignies et al., 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The MPB’s role in sediment stabilization is further supported by its production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which enhance sediment cohesion and reduce erosion. Moreover, it contributes to nutrient cycling within coastal ecosystems, influencing the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential for primary production.

<p>Traditional field-based sampling methods have proven to be highly effective for studying coastal environments at localized or small spatial scales, providing detailed insights into species composition, habitat structure, and ecological interactions. However, these approaches face significant limitations when applied to broader spatial extents or temporal scales due to their labor-intensive nature and logistical constraints. This methodological gap poses challenges for evaluating large-scale patterns and long-term changes in coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows, mangroves, and tidal flats. Remote sensing technologies, with their ability to capture high-resolution data across extensive geographic areas and over multiple time periods, offer a powerful complementary tool to address these limitations. By integrating traditional methods with remote sensing approaches, it allows a more comprehensive understanding of coastal ecosystem dynamics, facilitating the assessment of both localized impacts and global trends. The following section explores how advancements in remote sensing technologies are transforming the study of coastal environments, enabling more efficient and scalable assessments.</p>

<p>Coastal environments represent highly dynamic and sensitive ecosystems shaped by complex interactions between natural processes and human activities. Remote sensing (RS) technologies are crucial for monitoring these regions, providing detailed data on shoreline erosion, habitat degradation, sediment dynamics, and water quality. This section reviews fundamental concepts and methodologies of RS applied to coastal environments.</p>
<p>RS defines the ability to retrieve information in a non-invasive way, without direct contact with the target. It relies on the propagation of signals, typically optical, acoustic, or microwave, between the target and the sensor. RS provides the basis to Earth observation (EO), where its methodologies facilitate large-scale and long-term data collection. Instruments on satellites, aircraft, and drones provide high-resolution imagery and measurements critical for monitoring environmental changes, mapping natural resources, and assessing land use patterns. These technologies enable systematic data collection over large areas and extended periods, supporting analyses such as deforestation, glacial melting, variations in ocean temperature, and changes in land use.</p>
<p>Some technical characteristics of remote sensing sensors can directly impact their ability to map coastal ecosystems. The next section explores these characteristics, illustrating their importance with examples of specific use cases.</p>

<p>Active remote sensing is a technique in which a sensor emits its own energy—typically in the form of electromagnetic radiation—toward a target and measures the energy reflected or backscattered from it. This method allows for the collection of data regardless of natural light conditions, enabling observations during both day and night and through various weather conditions.</p>
<p>The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor emit laser beams in the ultraviolet (UV), visible or infrared (IR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. By analyzing the return signal, they can estimate distances to objects or surfaces, detect optically active constituents in water bodies, and assess aerosols in the atmosphere <span class="citation" data-cites="jamet2019going dionisi2024exploring">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-dionisi2024exploring" role="doc-biblioref">Dionisi et al., 2024</a>; <a href="../References/references.html#ref-jamet2019going" role="doc-biblioref">Jamet et al., 2019</a>)</span></p>
<p>LiDAR works by emitting a beam of light and measuring the time it takes for the beam to return to the sensor. This process not only calculates distances but also captures the intensity of the returned signal. In many instances, multiple returns from a single pulse are measured, enabling the mapping of varying objects height within the same x and y coordinates. This capability allows the creation of precise, three-dimensional representations of the environment such as mapping the heights of trees in forests or measuring crop heights in agricultural fields <a href="#fig-LIDAR" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.5</span></a>. When ground height cannot be directly measured, LiDAR data can generate a digital surface model (DSM), which represents the uppermost layer of the environment. However, if multiple returns are recorded, it becomes possible to create both a DSM and a digital terrain model (DTM), which represents the ground surface, by differentiating between the surface and underlying layers. The difference between DSM and DTM can be used to assess living stock or biomass.</p>

<p>Achieving accurate 3D measurements of a target using LiDAR technology requires a high level of precision in assessing each parameter of the system. The quality of the final output depends on careful calibration and execution at every stage of the process. One critical step is ensuring the precise timing of the laser beam’s return after it reflects off the target. This timing directly determines the distance calculations that form the basis of the 3D structure. Equally important is the accurate positioning of the LiDAR sensor, which is often mounted on a drone, aircraft, or satellite. The sensor’s x, y, and z coordinates must be continuously tracked with a high degree of precision. To achieve this, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning systems are commonly employed. These systems enhance the accuracy of the positioning data by providing real-time corrections to the sensor’s GPS coordinates, ensuring minimal error and maintaining the integrity of the spatial measurements. Without such stringent measures, the resulting LiDAR data is prone to errors that can lead to distorted and noisy representations of the mapped surface. These inaccuracies not only diminish the reliability of the data but also compromise its utility for detailed analysis and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>In coastal environment monitoring, LiDAR systems are classified based on their emitted wavelengths, which determine their performance and application. These systems are categorized into “topographic LiDAR” and “bathymetric LiDAR,” each suited to specific tasks in coastal studies. Topographic LiDAR operates in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum (approximately 1000 nm) and is used to map terrestrial features, such as beach contours, vegetation density, rocky shore structures and man-made installations. Its ability to generate high-density point clouds stems from efficient operation at lower power. Unlike other types of LiDAR, NIR LiDAR requires less power, making it generally more affordable and compact. These attributes allow topographic LiDAR systems to be easily mounted on drone platforms, offering greater flexibility and accessibility for coastal monitoring. In contrast, bathymetric LiDAR, utilizing green (~532 nm) and red wavelengths, penetrates the water column to reveal submerged landscapes, including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and shallow seabeds. Operating within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is more susceptible to atmospheric scattering than NIR LiDAR, making it less suitable for terrestrial applications.</p>
<p>The Litto3D® product <span class="citation" data-cites="shom_bathymetry_litto3d_bzh_2018_2021">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-shom_bathymetry_litto3d_bzh_2018_2021" role="doc-biblioref">SHOM, 2021</a>)</span> consists in high-resolution bathymetric and topographic maps in coastal areas, created using LiDAR technologies. During airborne missions, the system captures terrestrial and submerged terrain features with exceptional precision. The topographic LiDAR achieves spatial resolution of 1 m, with vertical accuracy up to 20 cm under optimal conditions, such as minimal atmospheric interference, stable flight paths, and favorable weather. The bathymetric LiDAR maps underwater landscapes to depths of approximately 70 m, depending on water transparency. This dual-mode capability is essential for modeling complex coastal environments, seamlessly integrating terrestrial and marine datasets. The airborne platform enables rapid data acquisition over large areas, overcoming challenges associated with ground-based or shipborne methods. The fusion methodology used by Litto3D® ensures the precise alignment of terrestrial and marine datasets, resolving inconsistencies in elevation data at land-water interfaces. The resulting unified dataset accurately represents coastal environments and support diverse scientific and practical applications such as coastal risk assessment and ecological studies. Distributed by the Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine <span class="citation" data-cites="shom">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-shom" role="doc-biblioref">SHOM, 2024</a>)</span> and the Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestiere <span class="citation" data-cites="ign">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-ign" role="doc-biblioref">IGN, 2024</a>)</span>, this dataset is open-source but currently available only for selected coastal regions in France.</p>
<p>In this study, LiDAR data were utilized in <strong>Chapter 4</strong> using a drone-borne NIR LiDAR system. These data were employed to evaluate the elevation and slope of mudflats in French and Spanish estuaries and to map the spatial distribution of the invasive red macroalga <em>Gracilaria vermiculophylla</em>. In <strong>Chapter 5</strong>, the Litto3D product was used along with a water height dataset to assess the emersion time of seagrass meadows in Quiberon, France, during low tide. Since this thesis focuses on intertidal environment mapping, field campaigns were conducted during low tide to ensure optimal conditions for the effective use of NIR LiDAR providing unobstructed access to exposed intertidal zones.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="passive-remote-sensing"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Passive Remote Sensing</h3>
<p>Passive remote sensing is a method of collecting data about the Earth’s surface or atmosphere by measuring naturally emitted or sunlight-reflected electromagnetic radiation without actively transmitting signals. This technique relies on energy sources external to the instrument, such as sunlight for optical and near-infrared sensors or Earth’s thermal emissions for thermal infrared sensors.</p>
<p>Passive remote sensing is widely utilized in spaceborne satellite missions and has played a pivotal role in programs developed by major space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). For instance, Sentinel-2 which provides ESA’s highest spatial resolution imagery, employs passive sensors. Data measured by these sensors have been applied to monitor land cover, vegetation dynamics and coastal and in land water environments.</p>
<p>As sunlight enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it interacts with various gases and particles altering its properties. These interactions include scattering, absorption, and refraction. Scattering occurs when atmospheric molecules and aerosols disperse light in different directions, with shorter wavelengths like blue light being more strongly affected. Absorption results from atmospheric constituents such as ozone, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, which absorb energy at specific wavelengths, reducing the intensity of the transmitted light that reaches the Earth’s surface. Refraction occurs as light changes direction and speed while passing through atmosphere layers with varying densities.</p>
<p>When sunlight reaches Earth’s surface, it exhibits several behaviors, depending on the surface properties and the angle of incidence. These behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Absorption: The light is absorbed by the surface, converting it into heat or another form of energy. This process varies based on the biogeochemical characteristics of the surface, with darker surfaces typically absorbing more light.</p></li>
<li><p>Transmission: The light passes through the surface, entering a different medium, such as water or transparent materials. The extent of transmission depends on the material’s transparency and refractive index.</p></li>
<li><p>Reflection: The light that is neither absorbed nor transmitted is redirected back in the opposite direction. The amount of reflection depends on the surface’s albedo, with bright surfaces like snow reflecting more light compared to darker surfaces such as forests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Only reflected light can be detected by spaceborne sensors. The most used metric in passive remote sensing, to quantify electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is reflectance (<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>). <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is typically measured as the ratio of upwelling radiance <span class="math inline">\(L_u\)</span> to downwelling radiance <span class="math inline">\(L_d\)</span> (<a href="#eq-reflectance" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>1.1</span></a>). <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is defined as the radiant intensity per unit of projected area in a specified direction and is expressed in units of W.m<sup>-2</sup>.sr<sup>-1</sup>. <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, however, is dimensionless.</p>
<p><span id="eq-reflectance"><span class="math display">\[
R(\lambda) = \frac{L_u(\lambda)}{L_d(\lambda)}
\tag{1.1}\]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is defined for each wavelength as a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that all light has been absorbed or transmitted by the target, while a value of 1 indicates that all light has been reflected.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA), i.e., the magnitude directly measured by spaceborne or airborne sensors contains signals originating from both the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface. Therefore, to study targets located on the Earth’s surface, <span class="math inline">\(R_{TOA}\)</span> must undergo atmospheric correction processing to transform it into Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, which represents the intrinsic reflectance properties of the surface target. Precise <span class="math inline">\(R_{BOA}\)</span> is crucial for accurately analyzing surface characteristics and for applications like vegetation monitoring, water quality assessment, and land cover classification.</p>
<p>One of the most basic atmospheric correction methods is the “black pixel” method, which assumes that all the signal retrieved over optically deep waters originates entirely from the atmosphere. This information is then used to correct the reflectance across the entire scene. However, this method requires the presence of optically deep water targets within the scene and assumes uniform aerosol concentrations across the scene. Such assumption may be inaccurate, particularly for satellites with a wide field of view, such as MODIS, where a single image can cover a swath of 2,330 km. Limitations to this technique arise also when the target of study is a water body itself. These limitations highlight the need for more advanced correction techniques that account for spatial variability in atmospheric properties.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, sophisticated atmospheric correction algorithms tailored to specific sensors and study areas have been developed. These algorithms account for atmospheric scattering, absorption, and path radiance contributions by leveraging radiative transfer models, auxiliary atmospheric data, and sometimes <em>in situ</em> measurements. For example, data of the ESA constellation Sentinel-2 can be processed using Sen2Cor, a correction algorithm designed to produce <span class="math inline">\(R_{BOA}\)</span> by incorporating atmospheric parameters such as water vapor, aerosols, and ozone concentrations. Additionally, some atmospheric correction methods are customized for specific targets, for example, algorithms specifically designed for water bodies, such as POLYMER <span class="citation" data-cites="steinmetz2011atmospheric">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-steinmetz2011atmospheric" role="doc-biblioref">Steinmetz et al., 2011</a>)</span> or ACOLITE <span class="citation" data-cites="vanhellemont2018atmospheric">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-vanhellemont2018atmospheric" role="doc-biblioref">Vanhellemont and Ruddick, 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_{BOA}\)</span> provides information regarding light reflected by the target across various wavelengths. This phenomenon, referred to as the spectral signature, is a unique feature of each target type. Spectral signatures contain data about the physical and chemical properties of surfaces, forming the basis for RS applications. By analyzing spectral signatures, its possible to identify and classify surface types, as well as derive insights into environmental changes and land-use dynamics. For example, Chlorophyll-a (Chla), a pigment found in all vegetation cells, plays a key role in defining the spectral signature of plant life. Chla absorbs light in specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in the blue region around 440 nm and the red region near 675 nm. Consequently, healthy vegetation exhibits a spectral signature with low <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> at 440 and 675 nm. Variations in physiological states and vegetations types result in different spectral patterns, enabling their differentiation and monitoring of ecological conditions over time (<a href="#fig-Spectral_signature" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.7</span></a>).</p>

<p>Spectral indices are mathematical combinations of reflectance values at specific wavelengths, designed to maximize particular surface characteristics with simple processing. Vegetation indices, for example, leverage the distinct reflectance patterns of photosynthetic pigments. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used index based on the normalized difference between <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> in the NIR and red. It is calculated as:</p>
<p><span id="eq-NDVI"><span class="math display">\[
NDVI = \frac{R(NIR)-R(Red)}{R(NIR)+R(Red)}
\tag{1.2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R(NIR)\)</span> is the reflectance in the infrared region around 800 nm and <span class="math inline">\(R(Red)\)</span> is the reflectance in the red region arround 665 nm.</p>
<p>NDVI values range from -1 to 1, with negative values indicating water and higher positive values corresponding to dense healthy vegetation. While NDVI serves as a proxy for vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity, its interpretation can be complex in heterogeneous environments, such as areas with overlapping vegetation types or substrates. Some studies propose a simple classification of NDVI based on thresholds to differentiate between distinct types of habitats or vegetations <span class="citation" data-cites="meleder2003cartographie">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-meleder2003cartographie" role="doc-biblioref">Vona Méléder et al., 2003</a>)</span>. While this simple first approximation can be useful for delimitating contrasting types of targets, establishing thresholds depends on specific sensor characteristics and this technique often fails in mapping vegetation types with similar pigment content or highly heterogeneous targets. More sophisticated techniques that utilize a greater amount of spectral information are required in such situations <span class="citation" data-cites="oiry2021using">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-oiry2021using" role="doc-biblioref">Oiry and Barillé, 2021</a>)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_{BOA}\)</span> can be used to identify key absorption features of chemical compounds of the traget, by applying derivative analysis to the spectral signature. The second derivative of the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is utilized to enhance the detection of subtle pigment or mineral absorption features. By analyzing the second derivative, these small features are amplified, allowing for more precise identification of pigment presence and estimation of their concentrations. This approach is particularly effective for identifying accessory pigments that have weaker absorption features compared to Chla.</p>
<p>Some technical characteristics of remote sensing sensors can directly impact their ability to map coastal ecosystems. The next section explores these characteristics, illustrating their importance with examples of specific use cases.</p>

<p>The detection of pigments absorption features necessitates measuring light reflectance at fine spectral resolution. However measuring detailed spectral signatures depends on the sensor’s characteristics.</p>
<p>Spectral resolution is defined by three main components: the number of spectral bands, the bandwidth (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM), and the spectral sampling interval. Sensors with higher spectral resolution can distinguish between closely spaced wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum, enabling precise characterization of spectral features (<a href="#fig-Spectral_resolutions" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.8</span></a>).</p>

<p>Remote sensing sensors are generally classified into two categories based on their spectral resolution: multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. Multispectral sensors are characterized by a limited number of broad spectral bands, with a bandwidth generally exceeding 20 nm. The spectral sampling interval is relatively large, resulting in a coarser spectral resolution that provides a broad overview of the spectral characteristics of a scene. In contrast, hyperspectral sensors are equipped with hundreds of narrow, contiguous spectral bands. These bands are separated by small spectral sampling intervals, often just a few nanometers, which results in a much finer spectral details. High spectral resolutions, capturing subtle variations in absorption features and spectral shapes, allow distinguishing between targets with similar spectral characteristics, such as vegetation with similar pigment profile. Multispectral sensors, while less detailed, are efficient for general spectral analyses where fine discrimination is not required. Another specification of sensors in the spectral discrimination is the radiometric resolution. It refers to th precision at which the data are recorded by the sensor. It is defined by the number of discrete levels, or bits, used to represent the energy recorded for each pixel in an image. Higher radiometric resolution enables finer distinctions in brightness levels, which is particularly important for detecting subtle differences in reflectance and ensuring accurate analysis of surface features. For example, an 8-bit sensor can record 256 levels of intensity, while a 12-bit sensor can capture 4,096 levels, providing greater detail and dynamic range in the captured imagery (<a href="#fig-Spectral_resolutions" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.8</span></a> D).</p>

<h5 data-number="1.2.2.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spatial-resolution"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.1.2</span> Spatial resolution</h5>
<p>Spatial resolution, defined as the smallest discernible detail a sensor can detect on Earth’s surface, is another fundamental characteristic of RS sensors. It is typically represented by the ground area covered by a single pixel in an image and is influenced by the sensor’s instantaneous field of view (IFOV), which determines the angle of view and, consequently, the ground area visible to the sensor. A smaller IFOV or lower sensor altitude results in finer spatial resolution, enabling the detection of smaller features. For the same IFOV, sensors mounted on satellites can cover larger areas compared to those on drone, albeit with reduced detail.</p>
<p>Spatial resolution can range widely depending on the research objective and sensor platform. For instance, moderate-resolution sensors like MODIS aboard Terra and Aqua capture data at spatial resolutions of 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km, making them suitable for large-scale environmental monitoring. In contrast, Sentinel-2 provides higher spatial resolutions—10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for red-edge and shortwave infrared bands, and 60 meters for atmospheric correction bands—facilitating detailed observations for applications such as vegetation and land-use mapping. At the finer end, high-resolution sensors on platforms like Pleiades-Neo achieve sub-meter resolutions (e.g., 30 cm per pixel), ideal for precise Earth observations.</p>
<p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with high-resolution cameras, offer even finer spatial resolutions, often down to a few cm, even mm, depending on flight altitude and sensor specifications. This ultra-high resolution is particularly advantageous for heterogeneous site mapping. Chapter 3 will show that an ultra-high spatial resolution can be valuable for machine learning model training. However, such high resolution requires increased data storage and processing capacity, illustrating the trade-off between detail and operational feasibility.</p>
<p>In scenarios involving mixed vegetation types or intricate landscape features, coarse-resolution sensors may fail to capture fine-scale heterogeneity, limiting the accuracy of ecological or land-use analyses. Conversely, high-resolution imagery excels in such contexts but demands significant computational resources. Selecting the appropriate spatial resolution depends on specific research objectives and the spatial scale of the phenomena under investigation, underscoring the necessity of aligning sensor capabilities with study requirements.</p>

<section id="temporal-resolutions" class="level5" data-number="1.2.2.1.3">
<h5 data-number="1.2.2.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="temporal-resolutions"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.1.3</span> Temporal Resolutions</h5>
<p>Another key characteristic of remote sensing sensors is their temporal resolution, defined as the time interval between successive image acquisitions over the same study site. Temporal resolution is critical for monitoring dynamic environments, such as coastal ecosystems, where conditions can change rapidly due to tides, weather events, or human activity.</p>
<p>Temporal resolution varies significantly depending on the sensor’s design and mission. For example, the Sentinel-2 constellation, composed of two satellites, offers a temporal resolution of 5 days at the equator. This revisit time improves to approximately 3 days at higher latitudes, such as in France, due to the overlap in satellite paths. Such frequent revisits make Sentinel-2 an excellent choice for applications requiring consistent monitoring, such as vegetation health assessments, sediment transport studies, or vegetation phenology estimations. Certain missions, like Sentinel-3, achieve even shorter revisit times. Equipped with sensors designed for ocean and land monitoring, Sentinel-3 provides near-daily coverage, making it particularly suited for applications that require high temporal frequency, such as tracking phytoplankton blooms, which can appear and disappear within a few days, or surface temperature variations. This capability is crucial for capturing fast-evolving phenomena and ensuring timely data delivery for decision-making.</p>
<p>The temporal resolution of a satellite sensor may vary from hours to days, depending on whether the platform orbit is geostationary or sun-synchronous. Geostationary satellites provide continuous coverage over a fixed location, while sun-synchronous orbits follow sun illumination, allowing image acquisition at the same time of the day for a location. This consistency is particularly important for visible-infrared sensors, as it ensures usable images and maximizes the temporal resolution of the sensor by avoiding night-time acquisitions. On the other hand, airborne platforms exhibit more variable temporal resolutions, ranging from days to years, depending on mission planning.</p>
<p>Usually, temporal resolution is highly dependent on the spatial resolution of the sensor. Higher spatial resolution often corresponds to lower temporal resolution, although geostationary platforms and pointable sensors can be exceptions to this trend (<a href="#fig-ResolutionSatellite" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.9</span></a>).</p>
<p>In contrast, some sensors are operated on-demand, with data acquisition triggered directly by the user. This is particularly characteristic of drones and specialized satellite missions like Pleiades or PRISMA. While these systems may lack consistent temporal archives for a given study site, they provide unmatched flexibility for high-resolution data collection. Such sensors are invaluable for addressing specific research objectives, including acquiring detailed imagery immediately after extreme weather events or capturing localized features with high spatial precision, complementing routine satellite-based monitoring programs.</p>

<p>Remote sensing involves inherent trade-offs between spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions, and coverage area, which influence the suitability of sensors for different applications (<a href="#fig-ResolutionSatellite" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.9</span></a>). High spatial resolution sensors, capable of capturing fine-scale details, are essential for precise tasks like urban infrastructure mapping or site-specific ecological studies. In coastal environments, high-resolution sensors are invaluable for identifying small-scale features such as intertidal vegetation patterns, sediment deposition dynamics, or the mapping of coral reef health. However, these sensors typically have lower temporal resolution and smaller coverage areas, limiting their utility for monitoring dynamic or widespread phenomena, such as tracking algal bloom events across entire coastal regions.</p>

<p>In contrast, sensors with coarser spatial resolution offer extensive coverage and higher revisit frequencies, making them ideal for tracking large-scale environmental changes. For coastal areas, these sensors can effectively monitor phenomena such as sea surface temperature variability, coastal erosion trends, and seasonal changes in primary productivity over larger geographic extents. For example, instruments like MODIS or VIIRS are well-suited for observing ocean color and Chla concentrations, which are critical for understanding broader ecosystem health in coastal zones.</p>
<p>Intermediate-resolution sensors provide a compromise, offering sufficient spatial detail for regional studies while maintaining adequate temporal resolution for periodic monitoring. These are particularly useful for applications such as mapping coastal vegetation transitions, estuarine dynamics, and changes in sediment plumes from rivers into the ocean over time. Instruments like Sentinel-2 or Landsat provide this balance, making them key assets for monitoring coastal ecosystems at scales relevant to regional management.</p>
<p>The selection of an appropriate sensor depends on the specific requirements of the study, balancing the need for detail, frequency, and geographic extent. Coastal zone management, for instance, often benefits from using a combination of sensors to capture both fine-scale spatial patterns and broader temporal trends, ensuring comprehensive monitoring of these dynamic environments.</p>
<p>While satellite acquisitions are essential for covering large areas, heterogeneous habitats often require finer spatial resolutions, positioning drones as the most suitable observation tool. Drone-based studies can also serve as proof-of-concept techniques to refine and develop methodologies that are later applicable to satellite data.</p>
<p>Although this work builds upon many of the concepts introduced in the previous sections, one critical remote sensing technique warrants further discussion in this introduction. This technique, characterized by its adaptability and technical precision, provides essential insights and complements the methods already outlined. The next section will introduce drones, focusing on their application as a remote sensing tool and detailing the associated techniques and data analysis methods.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, Julius Neubronner, a German apothecary, faced a logistical challenge in his professional practice. Neubronner regularly relied on carrier pigeons to deliver and retrieve small, urgent medical packages, such as medications or prescriptions, between his pharmacy and a sanatorium located several kilometers away. This method, though efficient for short distances, often left Neubronner curious about the exact routes taken by the pigeons and the environmental conditions they encountered during their flights. Motivated by both practical concerns and a spirit of innovation, Neubronner sought a way to monitor and document the journeys of his pigeons. He developed a lightweight, auto-triggering camera that could be strapped to the pigeons’ chests (<a href="#fig-pigeons" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.10</span></a> Top). The camera was designed to automatically take photographs at regular intervals during the birds’ flights. It had two lenses and a pneumatic system; it was activated by inflating the left chamber and as the air slowly escaped from the capillary at the bottom, the piston moved back triggering the exposure. Neubronner ensured that the camera was light enough not to impede the pigeons’ ability to fly <span class="citation" data-cites="simic2018drones">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-simic2018drones" role="doc-biblioref">Simic Milas et al., 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The resulting aerial photographs offered a novel perspective, capturing bird’s-eye views of landscapes, towns, and natural features (<a href="#fig-pigeons" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.10</span></a> Bottom). These images not only satisfied Neubronner’s initial curiosity about the pigeons’ routes but also demonstrated the broader potential of aerial photography for cartography, reconnaissance, and environmental observation. His innovative work garnered widespread attention, paving the way for further developments in remote sensing and aerial imaging. Neubronner’s experiments illustrated the practical applications of aerial imaging at a time when such perspectives were almost entirely unavailable, highlighting his contributions to both science and art.</p>
<p>Julius Neubronner’s early vision exemplifies how innovative thinking can overcome barriers in data collection. For many years, the practical limitations of remote sensing technologies, particularly with regarding spatial and temporal resolution or the high costs and delays in data acquisition, constrained their applicability in various fields. However, innovations like drones have significantly addressed these challenges. Much like Neubronner’s pigeons, modern drones are not only accessible and affordable but also offer users the freedom to determine when and where to deploy them, providing unparalleled control over spatial and temporal data collection. Neubronner’s ingenuity in developing lightweight aerial cameras for pigeons paved the way for these advancements, demonstrating the enduring impact of pioneering solutions in expanding the potential applications of remote sensing.</p>
<p>Modern drone history has its roots in military applications, where the need for unmanned surveillance and targeted operations drove the initial technological advancements. Early drone systems, such as the use of radio-controlled aircraft in World War II, laid the foundation for what would become an essential tool in both civilian and military contexts. The transition to civilian applications gained momentum in the late 20th century, particularly with the advent of lightweight materials, improved battery technologies, and advances in GPS and remote sensing capabilities. Today, drones are integral to various industries, from precision agriculture and infrastructure inspection to environmental monitoring and emergency response. This evolution reflects the growing accessibility and versatility of drone technology, making it a transformative element in modern data acquisition and analysis.</p>

<p>Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are aircraft systems operated without a human pilot onboard. They are often embedded with GPS and can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans. These devices have become indispensable tools in modern remote sensing, offering high accuracy, on-demand data acquisition, and the ability to access previously unreachable locations. The growing use of drones in various fields, from environmental monitoring to urban planning, underscores their versatility and importance.</p>

Figure&nbsp;1.11: Schematic representation of image overlap of a drone
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A key parameter in drone-based image acquisition is the overlap between images (<a href="#fig-overlaps" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.11</span></a>). This is categorized as front overlap (FO), which refers to the overlap between consecutive images along the same flight path, and side overlap (SO), which pertains to the overlap between images from adjacent flight paths. Ensuring sufficient overlap is essential for accurate reconstruction of orthomosaics through photogrammetric processes. Typically, 80% front overlap and 70% side overlap are considered optimal to achieve reliable results. The mathematical definitions of FO and SO are as follows:</p>
<p><span id="eq-FO"><span class="math display">\[
\text{FO} \;=\;
\left(1 - \frac{v \times \Delta t}
{\frac{H \times h_{\text{sensor}}}{f}}\right)\times 100
\tag{1.3}\]</span></span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span id="eq-FO"><span class="math display">\[
\text{SO} \;=\;
\left(1 - \frac{d_{\text{flight_line}}}
{\frac{H \times w_{\text{sensor}}}{f}}\right)\times 100
\tag{1.4}\]</span></span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>: Flight altitude above the ground (m) <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: Camera focal length (mm) <span class="math inline">\(h_{\text{sensor}}\)</span>: Sensor dimension (height) in the flight direction (mm) <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{sensor}}\)</span>: Sensor dimension (width) perpendicular to the flight direction (mm) <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>: Ground speed of the drone (m.s<sup>-1</sup>) <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>: Time interval between consecutive photos (s) <span class="math inline">\(d_{\text{flightline}}\)</span>: Distance between two adjacent flight lines (meters)</p>
<p>These equations show that for a given sensor (e.g., for known <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h_{\text{sensor}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{sensor}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>), the only parameters that can be adjusted to ensure sufficient overlap are the flight speed or the altitude of flights. If the user chooses to set <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> (directly linked to the spatial resolution of the final product), then <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> will be automatically fixed by the system. The higher the flight altitude, the higher the flight speed, or conversely, if the user chooses to set <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> (directly linked to the total time of the mission), then the altitude will be locked by the system, resulting in a higher <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> corresponding to a higher flight height.</p>
<p>The area that can be covered by a drone during a mission grows exponentially as the flight height increases. However, while the maximum flight height drones can technically reach is not inherently limited, it is strictly regulated by law. In Europe, for instance, the maximum permitted flight height is 120 m. This restriction can be a limiting factor for certain applications, particularly when the area to be covered exceeds several square kilometers. For instance, the largest intertidal meadow in France is located in the Bassin d’Arcachon and covers an area of nearly 40 km² <span class="citation" data-cites="cognat2018environmental">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-cognat2018environmental" role="doc-biblioref">Cognat et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Using a Micasense RedEdge-MX DUAL multispectral sensor mounted on a drone flying at 120 m altitude at 10 m.s⁻¹, this area would take approximately 44 hours of flight time to cover entirely. The total time required to map this entire area at low tide could be further extended when accounting for constraints such as daylight hours, tides cycles, battery recharging, potential weather-related delays, and the need for the operator to frequently reposition themselves due to regulatory restrictions that limit the drone’s distance to 1 km from the telepilot.</p>

<p>Satellite products produced by space agencies are often provided to users after extensive preprocessing steps, including orthorectification, precise georeferencing, radiometric calibration. Similarly, these preprocessing steps are crucial for utilizing drone-acquired data effectively. Nowadays, user-friendly software such as Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D enables users to perform these essential steps efficiently, making advanced data processing accessible even to non-expert users. Steps to obtain an orthoimage from a bunch of single images will be described now be describe in more details.</p>

<p>The first step is to correct each individual image acquired by the drone from optical distortion that occurred during its acquisition. Photogrammetric software typically addresses lens distortion and vignetting through a combination of camera calibration and radiometric adjustments. During calibration, the software refines intrinsic parameters such as focal length, principal point offsets, and radial/tangential distortion coefficients (called k1, k2, k3, p1, p2) by matching features across overlapping images in a bundle adjustment process. Some camera manufacturers provide sensor-specific metadata, including correction factors, which can further enhance calibration accuracy. Vignetting, which manifests as reduced brightness near the image edges, is often corrected via additional vignetting coefficients or automated radiometric calibration routines that normalize illumination across photos. These corrections are essential for ensuring both geometric precision in the 3D reconstruction and radiometric consistency in the final orthomosaic.</p>

<p>Once corrected, each image can be aligned. During the initial image alignment phase, the photogrammetry software relies on Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms to identify unique tie points in overlapping images and triangulate their 3D positions. These tie points are then matched across the dataset, and a bundle adjustment is performed to optimize camera parameters (position, orientation, and intrinsic calibration). Often referred to as aerial triangulation, this step produces a sparse point cloud that underpins all subsequent stages. Its accuracy is critical, as it defines the precision of the final 2D and 3D outputs.</p>

<p>Building upon the camera geometry established by SfM, the software uses Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to compute dense depth maps for each overlapping image pair. These depth maps are merged to create a dense point cloud containing millions—or even billions—of points, capturing high-resolution details of the scene’s geometry. Although computationally intensive, this phase lays the groundwork for generating accurate surface models and textured 3D representations later in the workflow.</p>

<p>From the dense point cloud, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) is derived by capturing the highest elevation values within each pixel or grid cell, thereby representing above-ground features like buildings and vegetation. Alternatively, a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) can be produced by classifying and removing non-ground points to approximate the bare-earth surface. Both models are typically exported as raster files and used in various analytical applications, such as hydrological modeling, viewshed analysis, and volume calculations. Their accuracy depends on the quality of the dense cloud and effective point classification techniques.</p>

<p>During orthorectification, the software projects each image onto the DSM or DTM to correct for camera tilt and terrain distortions, ensuring consistent spatial alignment. Afterwards, overlapping images are seamlessly blended—often balancing color and brightness variations—to form a georeferenced orthomosaic. This final 2D product is dimensionally accurate and vital for cartographic and analytic tasks, offering a reliable visual representation of the surveyed area.</p>

<p>Following the creation of a dense point cloud (<a href="#sec-DPC" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 1.2.3.4.3</span></a>), photogrammetric software can convert the millions of data points into a continuous 3D surface known as a mesh. This process involves triangulating the points to form a polygonal framework that captures the shape and features of the surveyed scene. Once the mesh is generated, the software projects the original imagery onto the surface to create a photorealistic texture. This textured 3D model provides an immersive visualization, enabling more detailed analysis of structures, terrain, and other elements than would be possible through a 2D map alone.</p>
<p>Another optional step, depending on the dataset, is the radiometric calibration of the data. However, this step becomes mandatory for multispectral and hyperspectral datasets, as it ensures the accuracy and usability of radiometric informations by compensating for sensor-specific biases and environmental conditions during data acquisition.</p>

<p>Coastal environments represent highly dynamic and sensitive ecosystems shaped by complex interactions between natural processes and human activities. Remote sensing technologies are crucial for monitoring these regions, providing detailed data on shoreline erosion, habitat degradation, sediment dynamics, and water quality. High-resolution satellite imagery and drone-based platforms facilitate the detection of fine-scale changes in intertidal zones, mangroves, coral reefs, and other critical coastal habitats. These observations enable the quantification of spatial and temporal variations, informing evidence-based strategies for conservation and sustainable management.</p>
<p>Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) and Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) constitute a framework for systematically monitoring and understanding ecological and oceanographic changes. Based on the model of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), EBVs provide a standardized set of biodiversity metrics to detect and analyze changes across spatial and temporal scales. These variables act as an interface between raw ecological data and the biodiversity indicators required for global reporting and policy-making. Similarly, EOVs focus on the biological and ecological characteristics of marine systems, emphasizing metrics such as plankton diversity and biomass, fish populations, and the spatial extent of habitats like coral reefs and seagrass meadows. By standardizing biodiversity and oceanic assessments, EBVs and EOVs enhance consistency and comparability across studies and regions <span class="citation" data-cites="muller10satellite">(<a href="../References/references.html#ref-muller10satellite" role="doc-biblioref">Muller-Karger et al., 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Discriminating between different types of intertidal vegetation using remote sensing poses significant challenges due to overlapping spectral signature in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions caused by similar pigment compositions. This issue is particularly pronounced when comparing green macroalgae and seagrass. In addition to chlorophyll-a, a pigment found in all vegetal cells, both green macroalgae and seagrass share the same accessory pigments such as chlorophyll-b and carotenoids. These shared pigments pronounce analogous reflectance patterns, making it difficult to differentiate between these vegetation types using conventional remote sensing techniques, especially in heterogenous habitats where these species often co exist. Despite these challenges, advances in spectral resolution and machine learning provide avenues for improved classification. The descrimination of vegetation type trhought remote sensing rely on differences in their spectral signature. The variability of spectral signatures of vegetation as been well studied for terrestrial plant, to our knowleadge, no studies has been performed on the variability of spectral signature of marine vegetation under stress conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The principal objective</strong> of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of remote sensing for mapping intertidal habitats and the environmental pressures they face, by developing advanced methodologies for accurate vegetation classification and ecosystem monitoring.</p>
<p>This goal will be reached through specific objectives proposed as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>analysing the potential of multi- and hyperspectral satellite missions (Pleiades, Sentinel-2, and PRISMA), as well as a multispectral drone sensor, for the discrimination of green macrophytes from low tide soft-bottom intertidal areas when exposed using remote sensing.</p></li>
<li><p>Building an algorithms able to descriminate amoug the 5 most commun taxonomic classes of vegetation found on soft sediment intertidal substrats.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate the capacity of remote sensing to monitor coastal environment under abiotic and biotic pressures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong> establishes the foundation by presenting a proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the feasibility of distinguising different types of vegetation using remote sensing. It demonstrates that this technique can effectively separate green macroalgae from seagrasses. By employing both multi- and hyperspectral datasets, the study identifies the number of spectral bands and specific wavelengths that maximize classification accuracy, showcasing the potential of remote sensing for detailed habitat mapping.</p>
<p>Building upon the proof of concept, <strong>Chapter 3</strong> focuses on the development of a robust algorithm called DISCOV v1.0, capable of automating the discrimination of green macrophytes in heterogeneous intertidal habitats. Utilizing high-resolution multispectral drone imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, this chapter addresses the spatial complexity of these environments. The algorithm’s validation across diverse geographic and ecological settings ensures its applicability beyond the initial study sites. This advancement underscores the critical role of cutting-edge remote sensing technologies in ecological monitoring.</p>
<p>In <strong>Chapter 4</strong>, the methodology evolves to include red macroalgae, specifically targeting the invasive species <em>Gracilaria vermiculophylla</em>. By updating the algorithm in its v2.0, this study extends its application to a different taxonomic group, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of the approach. Additionally, this chapter integrates LiDAR-based topographical data to examine the relationship between habitat characteristics and macroalgal distribution. The insights gained from mapping and modeling the spatial dynamics of <em>G. vermiculophylla</em> provide valuable implications for managing invasive species and conserving native biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong> examines the physiological impacts of environmental stressors, specifically marine and atmospheric heatwaves, on seagrass reflectance. Through controlled laboratory experiments and field validations, this chapter highlights the spectral responses of <em>Zostera noltei</em> under heatwave conditions. Well-established spectral indices such as the NDVI and GLI are employed, and a new index, the Seagrass Heat Shock Index (SHSI), is developed to specifically identify heatwave-impacted seagrasses. These indices provide metrics to detect and quantify stress-induced changes. These findings emphasize the role of remote sensing in assessing the resilience and vulnerability of intertidal ecosystems under climate change.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>General conclusion and futur perspectives</strong> section will close the work, discussing about the broader implication of this work and suggesting futur directions for research and application. This section will synthesize the key findings from each chapter, highlighting how the advancements in remote sensing methodologies contribute to improved habitat monitoring and management of intertidal ecosystems. It will also emphasize the potential for these approaches to be adapted to other coastal and marine environments, supporting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience in the face of global environmental changes. Future perspectives will explore opportunities to further enhance remote sensing techniques, such as integrating additional data sources like satellite imagery, and advanced field validation methods. Additionally, potential applications for policy-making, ecosystem restoration, and long-term environmental monitoring will be discussed, emphasizing the critical role of technology in addressing ecological challenges and guiding sustainable coastal management practices.</p>
